Nevertheless, actual travel narratives--narratives about the actual physical visits of writers to distant lands--call for careful and critical analysis because they can be seductive, and they can shape the ways we think about the present--and the past--of distant lands and cultures. This course discusses Arab, Indian, European, African and African American travel narratives about various regions of Africa since the 14th century. We will mine the travel accounts for descriptions of local contexts. We will also explore what travel writing says about the author's perceptions of self, home, and ""other."" Ultimately, we will investigate the authors' biases and how the narratives influence both our perception of Africa and the writing of African history.

Students will be required to do assigned listening and read related criticism and biographical material. In addition, students will write several responsive papers summarizing these listening and reading experiences. Each student will also write a biographical paper about a composer (or composer/arranger) of her choice, and participate in a collaborative presentation at the end of the semester on a composition or set of compositions from a list of possibilities provided by the instructor. Midterm and final examinations will focus on analytical aural skills developed during the semester, both in terms of formal analysis and composer identification.

Accordingly, the course introduces students to several genres, including historical documents, cultural criticism, music, literature, film, photography and art. The course does not draw on a musicological method but rather a socio-cultural analysis of the concept, music and its effect--so students are not required to have any prior musical knowledge or ability. In this writing intensive course, students will write short close analyses of multiple types of media, ultimately building up to an argumentative essay.

This course examines this transition.  How did it come about?  To what extent were African Americans able to exercise their rights that the constitution guaranteed?  How did Emancipation shape African American family relations, culture and demography?   This is a research seminar.  We will examine work of historians and discuss the contradictions and nuances of emancipation.

By comparing and contrasting different experiences of independence--in the Caribbean,  in independent Ghana, and in anti-apartheid South Africa--this course will grapple with the ways in which racism, political power, and cultural difference affected relations between Blacks, mulattoes, whites, and Indians in these countries as they fought for independence.

The course illuminates such submerged, neglected, and contested bodies of knowledge by focusing on eight concepts: justice, rights, recognition, freedom, equality, democracy, love, and judgment.  Through these principles, students are able to address how we frame questions of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, authenticity, the public sphere, incarceration, and globalization.  Our meetings consider the popular and the underground, the originally forged and the remixed, the utility of nomenclature bifurcating conscious and radical hip-hop on the one hand and alternative modes following the logic of neoconservatism and neoliberalism on the other, examining throughout the interplay among language, aesthetics, and form.  We investigate as well whether hip-hop in the United States and around the world is intrinsically a political, anti-political, or neutral force in the realm of politics.

This may be due to its abstractness as an idea and the level of analysis its conceptualization demands, or because time in the African American experience cannot be understood outside of the meaning of race, which itself is far from tangible.  In this tutorial, ""Time and Blackness,"" we will explore how African American writers across a number of genres understand time.  We will read select texts of fiction as well as spiritual autobiographies, historical narratives, and sociological studies to understand how writers draw from -- and create --paradigms of time to organize their work.  The following questions will structure our investigation:  What are the constituent elements of time in African American writing?

Butler (1947-2006) is among the most highly regarded science fiction writers. Butler's uncanny ability to imagine the future anew and to merge those ruminations with her experiences as an African American woman provide powerful commentary on -- and often disrupt -- modern understandings of race, gender, and human embodiment. We will explore questions such as: What role does `gender' play in Butler's fiction? How does Butler's treatment of the `alien' cause us to reconsider what it means to be human? How does Butler incorporate `race' and the concept of `other' into her fiction, and how do these techniques help us situate contemporary discussions of a post-race society? We will examine the relationship between Butler's visions for the future and what her narratives of future worlds invariably suggest about the present. We will read key texts including the best-selling text <I>Kindred</I> (1979), the haunting dystopian novel <I>Parable of the Sower</I> (1994), the popular vampire text <I>Fledgling</I> (2005), and the collection <I>Bloodchild and Other Stories</I> (1996).

On one hand, the United States was founded on the principles of liberty and equality, and consequently the American ethos is largely characterized by individualism and egalitarianism. On the other hand, the U.S. has faced and continues to be challenged with matching its expectations and ideals of itself with reality, as there are on-going inequalities based on race, gender, religion, and sexuality. Nonetheless, one would have difficulty in arguing that American society has not improved at all, especially over the past half-century. The U.S. government -- via Congress, the Supreme Court, and Executive Orders of various Presidents -- has improved the well-being and status of racial minorities.  Further, the overwhelming majority of American citizens eschew racist language and attacks on racial and ethnic minorities. Some would argue that the election of the United States --  first Black president is a clear indication that the country is approaching -- if not already realizing -- its post-racial, American Dream. But, scholars who have tried to measure the significance, impact, and effect of race on American politics are currently engaged in a highly contested debate on the extent to which racism has declined in this society. In this tutorial, we will explore a variety of debates concerning the role of race in American society and American Politics. Have racial attitudes improved over the past 60 years or has the language of racial animus simply changed over that time? Are racial minorities failing to live up the opportunities provided to them by the U.S. Constitution and various other laws or are there structural barriers that are too high for them to overcome? Is the election of minority leaders in majority white districts a sign that racial attitudes have an insignificant influence on candidate evaluation and elections or have minority candidates deracialized their campaigns in a way that may ultimately disserve minority groups?

Baraka proposed  a populist modernism that would unite the most commercial and the most avant-garde streams of Black Music. The goal was to forge what Baraka called a Unity Music--one that would esthetically mirror and presage an ideal unification  of  divergent African American political philosophies and protest movements. 
The notion that Black Music could play a vital role in the pursuit of social justice gained popular and vocal modernist proponents during the 1920s Harlem Renaissance via Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, The Bebop Generation of Billie Holiday, Charlie Parker, Thelonius Monk, Dizzy Gillespie and Mary Lou Williams, Miles Davis and Max Roach who followed Ellington and Armstrong  built upon their innovations and anti-racist stances. The Beboppers have been described as the ''forerunners of the Civil Rights movement'' for their stance towards discrimination and radical experimentation. The post-bop and freedom jazz musicians such as Sun Ra, John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman, who carried the baton for freedom jazz in the late 50s and 60s came to sonically represent the fire and fury of the Civil Rights and Black Power movements. Through Baraka's own creative and rhetorical interventions their music became the artistic standard bearers of the Black Arts Movement. The socially conscious R&B and Funk of the 1970s as parlayed by bands such as Earth Wind and Fire, Parliament-Funkadelic, Rufus, War and Mandrill fused  the energy of freedom jazz with the populist modernism of funk avatars James Brown,  Curtis Mayfield, Jimi Hendrix and Sly Stone. Their work greatly influenced global pop insurgents such as Bob Marley and The Wailers and Fela Kuti who wrought critical hybrids of indigenous and imported forms to speak truth to power in their homelands, and beyond.
Hiphop culture inherited the popular modernist mantle  and openly radical-activist imperative jazz had largely abandoned by the 1990s. As hiphop evolved in that decade it became a platform for new alignments of  art, commerce and politics. Novel tensions emerged between the culture's pro-capitalist instincts and its desire to represent African American working class struggle. Hiphop music in Africa simultaneously blossomed as  a vehicle for anti-oppression and anti-corruption  activism. 
The course will draw heavily upon Baraka's seminal books <I>Blues People and Black Music</I>, alongside David Levering Lewis'  <I>When Harlem Was In Vogue</I> Tricia Rose's <I>Black Noise</I> and Jeff Chang's <I>Can't Stop Wont Stop</I> to revisit and re-interrogate these  historic epochs when music, politics and the marketplace converged to transform the relationships between activism, mass-culture-industry production and the social consumption of music.

Lorde was a queer feminist icon credited with furthering the concepts of intersectional identity and black feminism, while Baraka was accused throughout his career of obliviously brazen machismo and criticized for his use of homophobic invective.  Baraka endorsed the very notions of leadership and community from which Lorde crafted an identity of marginality, and Lorde endorsed a community-bound poetics contrasted to Baraka's avant-gardism. But for all their differences, Lorde and Baraka were arguably the two most significant African American writers of the late twentieth century, and, however surprisingly, they staked similar conceptual territory, addressing such themes as the possibility of spiritual self-discovery, the possibility of liberatory consciousness, the significance of emotions in building community, and the relationship between sexuality and racial identity. We will explore such issues by way of closely attending to their texts, and since another similarity between them was a prolific range of genre, we will have the opportunity to delve into poetry, essays, fiction, drama, and memoir, with a slight but definite preference for their poetry. We will also place these writers in their political and philosophical contexts, sampling secondary sources on the Black Arts movement, queer theory, contemporary American and African American poetry, and transnational black studies. As we will be discussing two writers whose collective contribution to minority discourse is nothing short of monumental, our course will participate in the College's Exploring Diversity Initiative.

Not surprisingly, it has had tumultuous relations with both its colonial occupier, France, and its most powerful neighbor, the United States.  From isolation and sanctions, to occupation and U.S. supported dictatorship, this seminar traces the historical silencing suffered by Haiti at the hands of western historians, the vivid images Haitians evoke in the American imagination--from boat people and carriers of Aids, to practitioners of voodoo and creators of a uniquely African-Caribbean art--and the role of the French and American governments in the recent coup against President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

Thus, the work is judged primarily in terms of its embodied sociological content (material, empirical) and not by ""abstract"" standards of aesthetic subtlety, philosophical sophistication, and so on. At the same time, in the popular and academic imaginary, minority subjects and artists poets occupy a single abstract signifying category--homogeneous, undifferentiated, ""other,"" marginalized, non-universal--while racially ""unmarked"" (white) artists occupy the position of being universal and individual at once. 
The irony, of course, is that, say, an African American poet's being read as an abstract signifier does not mean that the black subject or writer is seen as capable of engaging in abstract ideas. This course will ask questions about the problem of race and abstraction by looking at the work of various African American and Asian American writers, visual artists and musicians--including Will Alexander, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, David Hammons, Yayoi Kusama, Tan Lin, Nathaniel Mackey, and Cecil Taylor--as well as critics.

These lines suggest not only that each landscape inspires unique textual expressions but also that differing forms of literary language constitute environments unto themselves. We will explore a number of such literary environments with the aim of investigating a) how literary works evoke and grapple with the sensual and atmospheric qualities of places, b) how environment has played a role in shaping literary forms and canons, and c) the ways in which experimental engagements with place have broadened and disrupted our ideas about both literature and geography.

For instance, why is it important to some people to imagine that Pocahontas lived happily ever after with John Smith, or that Squanto gave us the first Thanksgiving? Such national myths are based on kernels of historical reality, but they also elide important details and oversimplify the lives of both Native and European protagonists. By learning more about the complex Native individuals behind the stereotypes, we will face our assumptions, identify the cultural work these images perform, and question why certain portrayals of Native peoples continue to thrive.

Given the geographical, racial, and cultural diversity of the United States, the ways in which Americans imagine nation inevitably vary over time, according to place, and among different individuals and groups. Rather than a survey of any one aspect or period of American history, literature, or popular culture, this course is an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of American Studies, a field defined both by the range of texts we read (essays, novels, autobiographies, photographs, films, music, architecture, historical documents, legal texts), and by the questions we ask of them: How have different Americans imagined what it means to be an American? What ideas about national history, patriotism, and moral character shape their visions of Americanness? How do the educational system, mass media, government policies regarding citizenship and immigration shape American identities? How are boundaries of inclusion and exclusion in the nation drawn?

We will examine the historical and contemporary experiences of America's ever-expanding religious diversity, prominently featuring the voices of those traditionally excluded from older, Protestant-informed accounts of American religion. The focus of the course will be the exploration of the ever-expanding variety of new religions in North America, challenging students to engage the numerous cultural, philosophical, and methodological issues involved with the study of marginal religions. New religions often highlight cultural anxieties, e.g. loss of identity in contemporary secular societies, responses to new technologies, changing gender roles, globalization, etc. The study of new religions becomes, then, a closer, reflexive examination of contemporary American culture and its underlying tensions. For example, the Raëlian Movement claims to have cloned the first human. Wicca, on the other hand, offers critiques of environmental depredation and traditional gender roles. In sum, we will explore the historical roots of the current boom in new religions, detail contemporary issues, and outline the possible forms new and emerging religions may assume in the coming years.

What are the overt and subtle ways that these films seek to interpret and employ biblical texts? Why do they draw upon the texts they do and read them as they read them? What can cinematic interpretations of biblical texts reveal to us about how these texts are used in broader U.S. culture? How does an awareness of this scriptural dimension in a work of ""popular culture"" affect our interpretation of both the film and the scriptural text's meanings? How do varying interpretations of biblical texts help us to understand cinematic meaning? By assuming that we can read both biblical texts and films in multiple and contradictory ways, this class can use film as the occasion for interpreting, analyzing, and debating the meanings, cultural functions, and affective responses generated by biblical narratives in film. Finally, this course asks us to analyze how movies may interpret certain biblical texts in order to crystallize and reflect certain political, economic, ethnic, racial, sexual, and social parameters of U.S. cultures.

Subsequent decades in the United States witnessed the end of segregation, passage of Civil Rights, liberalization of immigration policies, and the rise and dominance of ""multiculturalism"" in social, political, and academic spheres.  These landmark events and shifts contributed to a narrative of progress as the defining story of race in post-war America.  However, as Winant cautions, the ""break"" neither resolved nor abolished racism and racial hierarchies.  Our class will examine how this narrative of racial progress has been constructed, as well as the ways in which it has been critiqued and complicated.  In doing so, we will also pay attention to: shifting perception(s) of race/racial difference in global and transnational contexts, representations of race in cultural texts and discourse, cross-racial connections and formations, and inter-articulation of gender, sexuality, and class formations with race.

How have products - ranging from beer to deodorant to cigarettes -- had their use value articulated in gendered ways? Why must masculinity be the purview of ""males"" at all; how can we change discourses to better include performances of female masculinities, butch-identified women, and trans* men? We will pay particular attention to racialized, queer, and subaltern masculinities.

How did Katherine Dunham's dance performances in Germany help her shape a new black dance aesthetic? Why did writer James Baldwin go all the way to Switzerland to write his first novel on black, religious culture in Harlem? What drew actor/singer Paul Robeson to Russia, and why did the U.S. revoke his passport in response to his speeches abroad?

Within a few decades, it came to be placed first on the peninsula of Baja California and then upon a region stretching up the Western coast of North America. What aspects of this vision are still drawn upon in how we imagine California today? How did certain narratives of California come to be, who has imagined California in certain ways, and why? What is the relationship between certain myths, the peoples who have imagined them, and the other peoples who have shared California dreams? In this course, we will examine some of the myths that surround California by looking at a few specific moments of interaction between the peoples who have come to make California home and the specific places in which they have interacted with each other.

Eventually, black performers created their own versions of minstrelsy, black playwrights created dramas more sympathetic to black life, and representations of black life proliferated in every noteworthy medium. This course will consider how attitudes about blackness have informed or deformed theatrical representations of African American life.

Its reception has always been controversial and paradoxical: modernism either unleashes revolutionary thinking or displaces it (and either alternative may be its value); it either allows expression to repressed forms of sexuality or re-represses them; it either registers new racial realities or is specifically designed to keep racial structures in place.

Yet silent cinema represents an era of unparalleled transformation in which structures of narrative and the language of visual representation were virtually re-invented to meet the needs and the potentialities of a new medium, and the very relationship between art and entertainment was re-defined, producing hundreds of films that are the aesthetic equal of any contemporary work. The absence of synchronous sound allowed silent cinema a visual freedom that fostered forms of artistic experimentation unattainable in sound cinema, leading some aestheticians to proclaim the artistic superiority of silent cinema.  In this course we will survey classic narrative films by such directors as D. W. Griffith, Erich von Stroheim, and Abel Gance; stars of silent cinema such as Greta Garbo, Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and Rudolph Valentino; the flowering of American silent comedy in the work of Chaplin and Keaton; the creation of exciting new modes of political art by Eisenstein, Pudovkin, Vertov, and other directors of Soviet montage cinema; expressionist, surrealist, and other avant-garde work by such filmmakers as Murnau, Dulac, Man Ray, Buñuel, and Dreyer; and brilliant silent films by major directors better known for their sound films, such Ernst Lubitsch, Yasujiro Ozu, and Alfred Hitchcock.

We will continue with the contemporary inheritors of the tradition: Cornel West, Richard Rorty, and Hilary Putnam. Although it has influenced both analytic and continental philosophy, pragmatism is a powerful third philosophical movement. Always asking what practical difference would it make, our authors investigate the central questions and disputes of philosophy, from epistemology and metaphysics to ethics and religion. Rather than seeing philosophy as an esoteric discipline, the pragmatic philosophers (with the possible exception of Peirce) see philosophy as integral to our culture and see themselves as public intellectuals.

Lorde was a queer feminist icon credited with furthering the concepts of intersectional identity and black feminism, while Baraka was accused throughout his career of obliviously brazen machismo and criticized for his use of homophobic invective.  Baraka endorsed the very notions of leadership and community from which Lorde crafted an identity of marginality, and Lorde endorsed a community-bound poetics contrasted to Baraka's avant-gardism. But for all their differences, Lorde and Baraka were arguably the two most significant African American writers of the late twentieth century, and, however surprisingly, they staked similar conceptual territory, addressing such themes as the possibility of spiritual self-discovery, the possibility of liberatory consciousness, the significance of emotions in building community, and the relationship between sexuality and racial identity. We will explore such issues by way of closely attending to their texts, and since another similarity between them was a prolific range of genre, we will have the opportunity to delve into poetry, essays, fiction, drama, and memoir, with a slight but definite preference for their poetry. We will also place these writers in their political and philosophical contexts, sampling secondary sources on the Black Arts movement, queer theory, contemporary American and African American poetry, and transnational black studies. As we will be discussing two writers whose collective contribution to minority discourse is nothing short of monumental, our course will participate in the College's Exploring Diversity Initiative.

But as the great theorist of children's animation and stoner movies Jack Halberstam has noted, sometimes failure turns out to be a better bet than success: it can reveal the blindspots of dominant ideologies, while opening up alternative ways of living in the world.  This course will take a long detour through meditations on failure emerging from queer theory, Asian American studies, and black studies, with a particular interest in what failure can reveal about higher education and related disciplinary institutions, such as prisons or the so-called ""internment camps"" for Japanese Americans during World War II.  This course fulfills the Exploring Diversity requirement by considering how the stigmatization of difference and justification of social inequality are inscribed in supposedly neutral rubrics of success and failure.

And if we are never without the past, then ""whiteness"" must be a part of current discussions about politics, citizenship, and social issues. Focusing on how historians have written about whiteness in American history, this course uses the prism of race to explore social, political, and economic development in U.S. history. The class follows the development of ""whiteness"" through a chronology that begins in colonial Virginia, travels through immigration in the nineteenth century, examines racial politics and popular culture in the twentieth century, and  ends  with a look at the current election season. This course is framed by several questions: What is whiteness, and what has it meant in the history of the United States? Who is (and is not) white? What about other analytical categories, like gender and class (or region or ethnicity or sexuality): how have these experiences shaped and been shaped by the racial category of whiteness? Because historically whiteness has carried overtones of power, privilege, and wealth in the United States, the course necessarily critiques the roots of racial disparities. This class is not for the faint-hearted. Informed participation is necessary to its success.

What exactly makes the difference? This class will weigh the powers of words and pictures to represent persons, asking how artists in each medium try to define and convey something that feels like the truth of character. Is that truth hidden deep in our souls? Or is it the case that what you see, moment to moment, is all there is? We'll think through these aesthetic and psychological questions with a range of (mostly) nineteenth-century texts and an array of visual media. We'll see, too, how portraits confer or deny political and social power. Our texts will give us examples of the deadly male gaze (Poe), the mania for phrenology, the potential for daguerreotypes to reveal a villainous heart (Hawthorne), the existential and political consequences of passing (Larsen), the possibility that you are what you wear (James), and the promise of fingerprinting to prove who's who (Twain). These instances of fixing or manipulating identity will show us how slippery and how potent the concept of identity has been -- and still is -- in American culture.

The writing done by these mostly young, mostly urban, poets and fiction writers is some of the most exciting being written in the United States today; their texts push the boundaries of aesthetic form while simultaneously engaging questions of culture, politics, and history.

However, political movements around the world have challenged these principles -- pointing to growing wealth inequality, environmental destruction, and negative cultural changes that have followed the implementation of neoliberal policies.  This interdisciplinary course will provide students with a detailed understanding of the concept and these ongoing debates.  We will begin by tracing the rise of neoliberal thinking in the fields of economics and public policy.  We will then explore its impact on American society, relying on sociological accounts of changes in welfare provision and education, as well as analyses of the political implications of reality television shows.

Thus, the work is judged primarily in terms of its embodied sociological content (material, empirical) and not by ""abstract"" standards of aesthetic subtlety, philosophical sophistication, and so on. At the same time, in the popular and academic imaginary, minority subjects and artists poets occupy a single abstract signifying category--homogeneous, undifferentiated, ""other,"" marginalized, non-universal--while racially ""unmarked"" (white) artists occupy the position of being universal and individual at once. 
The irony, of course, is that, say, an African American poet's being read as an abstract signifier does not mean that the black subject or writer is seen as capable of engaging in abstract ideas.

But one can also see the Cold War as setting in motion less immediately direct but nonetheless profound changes to the way that many people saw and planned for the environments around them, as evidenced, for instance, by the rise of the American suburb, the reconstruction of postwar Europe, and agricultural and industrial initiatives in many developing nations.

How does one frame intellectual problems and go about collecting, sifting, and assessing field materials? What are the uses and limits of statistical data?
What is the importance of history to sociological and anthropological research? How can one use archival and other documentary materials to enrich ethnographic research? What are the empirical limits to interpretation? What is the relationship between empirical data and the generation of social theory? How does the social organization of social research affect one's inquiry? What are the typical ethical dilemmas of fieldwork and of other kinds of social research? How do researchers' personal biographies and values shape their work? In the first half of the course, we will approach these problems concretely rather than abstractly through a series of case studies, drawing upon the field experiences of departmental faculty and guest speakers from different professional backgrounds.

Such beliefs are blamed for ""tribal"" violence in Pakistan's Frontier Regions, for dowry disputes in north India and for the persistence of corrupt dynasties in leading political parties. Yet these beliefs and practices aren't in fact old-fashioned or lawless, and many of them result from South Asia's unique historical position as a former British colony. In this class, we will use ethnographic and historical research to examine what law and kinship can teach us about how the past shapes the present in post-colonial South Asia. In particular, we'll examine how a perspective that seriously considers law and kinship can help us better understand contemporary dilemmas in South Asia, ranging from controversy over women¿s right to inherit property, to the role of caste in contemporary democratic politics. The course is organized into three sections. First, we will discuss kinship, reading classic theories of kinship in the region, as well as critiques of those theories, and ending with a contemporary dilemma, the problem of dowry ""pressure"". Next, we learn about how family relationships were codified legally, and how laws were shaped to respond to perceived family ""traditions,"" in colonial and post-colonial South Asia.

This course deconstructs the historic roots and ongoing causal factors that produce structural violence against women and religious minorities in modern India.  It highlights the social practices that have produced critical axes of difference around the themes of religion, gender, and sexuality using key moments or regions of India as points of departure.  It contrasts the explosive effects of religion, gender, and caste during the tragedy of Partition with the ongoing production of communal and gender-based violence in India today, using Kashmir and New Delhi as microcosms for our study. We will consider the ways that multiple subjectivities and polarized identities intersect with individual agency to produce a social landscape of hierarchy and conflict across India today.  We are also interested in the socio-cultural forces that reproduce or shore up these binaries as much as third terms or middle paths that attempt to transcend or diffuse them.  For instance, we explore the ways that Buddhism is and is not a middle way between Hindu/Muslim conflict in Indian Kashmir and how the notion of a third sex is and is not a middle term that transcends the gender binary of male/female.

In particular, it explores a South Asian sociology that links individual and social bodies in ways that occasion solidarity as well as social suffering, violence as well as communal cohesion. How do bodies come to signify the purity or prosperity of the nation or community and with what social or discursive effects? We begin by unpacking foundational theories of the body as proposed by Mauss, Foucault, Douglas, and Bourdieu in order to better understand how local discourses of the body help produce gender and other social hierarchies in South Asia. By considering how the human body can serve as a map for society and vice versa, we examine both classical discourses and modern institutional practices of the body including the temple, the monastery, the mosque, and the mendicant, as well as bodily practices such as yoga, celibacy, sex work, and new reproductive technologies.

On one hand, we use the tools of linguistic anthropology to ask about how systems of gender and sexuality are reproduced through everyday interactions. On the other hand, we examine how interactive norms regarding gender and sexuality then shape political, economic, and social processes beyond face-to-face interactions. In doing so, we will read a range of ethnographic material, both from the US and beyond, that examines how gender shapes interactions, whether in the context of a basketball game, a medical training course, a courtroom, a religious revival movement, or an international crisis.

As they lost their original object of study, however, anthropologists also discovered that the tools and concepts developed in the study of ""primitive"" cultures could be applied to the contemporary world. Exploring this possibility, this course examines the relevance of fundamental anthropological concepts that have developed through the structural and symbolic study of myth and ritual to the contemporary world in which we live. The course is divided into four sections. In the first unit, we read and discuss the work of Mary Douglas, Victor Turner, and Marshall Sahlins on myth and ritual, focusing in particular on the ways in which different cultures construct categories of inclusion and exclusion, safe and dangerous, pure and impure, while also creating the ""in between"" spaces within which both creativity and transgression emerge. On this foundation, we move to the second unit in which we discuss the structural relationship between ritual, power, and transgression in western contexts, taking the majority of our examples from early modern European and American history. In the third section of the course, we consider what an anthropological perspective can reveal about some seminal events in 20th century history, and we end the course by considering how anthropological theory informs two critical areas of current concern: immigration and national security.",seminar,"class participation, two short response papers, 10-page research paper, final exam","ANTH 101, SOC 101, REL 101, or any other ANTH or SOC course",19,19,"Anthropology, Sociology or Religion majors",,,,,,Division 2,,,Writing Intensive,,,,,,,,,,,01,SEM,Cancelled,,,Cancelled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ANTH, 299,1153

How do socially constructed ideas about nature, agrarian landscapes, and even particular environmental qualities such as soil and water, shape the formation of categories such as city, country, and region or even of specific food products? Through what processes do particular food products come to be distinctively place-based? How do we understand the seeming shift to place-based agriculture and food production, in the context of an industrialized and increasingly intricate global food system that has often homogenized and standardized food production? How is locality produced through food and agriculture, and how are food and agriculture produced through claims to locality and place? These interconnections, and the relations of power interlaced in them, are salient in contemporary praxis, and the course builds on grounded, conceptual understandings to explore contemporary phenomena such as the <I>appellation d'origine contrôlée</I> in France's wine producing regions, the development of Geographic Indication within the World Trade Organization, the formation of ""Organic Uttarakhand"" that is the subject of my own research, and the affective economies generated through artisanal food production.

The course will also examine the efforts of, first, the Soviet Union in the 1980s and, more recently, the United States and its allies to control the borderlands, and we will conclude with a consideration of the geopolitical implications if Afghanistan and Pakistan prove in the end to be ""failed states.""

Throughout history, however, we may also encounter many instances of asymmetric conflict within states, colonies, and other political entities, involving combatants who are often indistinguishable from the general population and whose objectives are often unlike those of states: Peasant revolts, revolutions, wars of independence or national liberation, and other forms of resistance and civil insurgency pit the relatively weak against the power of the state and may succeed because, to use Mao's metaphor, the insurgents move among the people like fish in water. The close relationship between insurgent fighters and the supporting population makes the social structure, social values, social institutions--in short, the culture--of the society particularly relevant to understanding the nature of a given asymmetric conflict. In this course we will use theoretical and analytical concepts from anthropology, sociology, history, and political philosophy to examine asymmetric conflicts of the twentieth century and the present day. The course will be divided into three parts: in the first we will explore some of the theoretical literature on violence and warfare as well as some of the basic literature on tribal and peasant society, peasant revolts, wars of national liberation, guerilla warfare, and insurgencies. The second part of the course will be devoted to presentations prepared by small groups of students on case studies, e.g., the Hukbalahap insurgency in the Philippines, the communist revolutions of China, Cuba, and Malaysia, wars of national liberation such as those in Algeria and Vietnam, and other ongoing civil conflicts such as the Palestinian intifadah and ""ethnic cleansing"" in the Balkans.

One's position in social space largely determines one's consciousness, identity, values, attitudes, interest, and behavior. While inequality is ubiquitous, there are cross-cultural variations in the definition of status and consequent distribution of social conditions and opportunities among individuals. In modern societies, social space and individual status are closely interconnected with the economic system and, consequently, with the occupational structures and relations evolving from it. Currently, globalization and technological developments are rapidly transforming societies and patterns of inequality. In stable societies, changes in the economic and social sphere are evolutionary in nature. However, these changes come at an accelerated pace and are typically accompanied by initial chaos and turbulence in societies undergoing major systemic transformation (or even revolution). These societies provide excellent opportunities to study the relationship of social change and stratification.

Despite scientific agreement about its existence and its causes, many people do not see climate change as a serious problem, or as a problem at all. Many others see it as the most serious problem our species has ever faced. What are the sources of this disparity? Why can't we agree about climate change? How does something as complex and confusing as climate change become a ""problem"" in the first place? This course will explore a broad array of factors, from religion to race, class to colonialism. It will focus especially closely on the communication of scientific knowledge, risk perception, and environmental ethics, and it will apply a range of theories from the social sciences and humanities to a set of concrete case studies In the climate change debate, culture matters.

On one hand, the United States was founded on the principles of liberty and equality, and consequently the American ethos is largely characterized by individualism and egalitarianism. On the other hand, the U.S. has faced and continues to be challenged with matching its expectations and ideals of itself with reality, as there are on-going inequalities based on race, gender, religion, and sexuality. Nonetheless, one would have difficulty in arguing that American society has not improved at all, especially over the past half-century. The U.S. government -- via Congress, the Supreme Court, and Executive Orders of various Presidents -- has improved the well-being and status of racial minorities.  Further, the overwhelming majority of American citizens eschew racist language and attacks on racial and ethnic minorities. Some would argue that the election of the United States --  first Black president is a clear indication that the country is approaching -- if not already realizing -- its post-racial, American Dream. But, scholars who have tried to measure the significance, impact, and effect of race on American politics are currently engaged in a highly contested debate on the extent to which racism has declined in this society. In this tutorial, we will explore a variety of debates concerning the role of race in American society and American Politics. Have racial attitudes improved over the past 60 years or has the language of racial animus simply changed over that time? Are racial minorities failing to live up the opportunities provided to them by the U.S. Constitution and various other laws or are there structural barriers that are too high for them to overcome? Is the election of minority leaders in majority white districts a sign that racial attitudes have an insignificant influence on candidate evaluation and elections or have minority candidates deracialized their campaigns in a way that may ultimately disserve minority groups?

We will attend to the historical emergence of the institutional forms that perpetrate this sequestration, and show how they have become tightly articulated with one another: hospitals, nursing homes, hospice centers, funeral homes, cemeteries. We will furthermore examine the peculiar bodies of expert knowledge that have arisen in tandem with these institutional forms, among them gerontology, thanatology, and bereavement therapy, showing how they have conspired in the pathologization and (bio)medicalization of aging, death, and grief.

We will begin the course by attending to the history of medicalization and its consequences. Taking guidance from key theoretical works and exemplary case studies, we will arrive at an understanding of medicalization as a {technical} process, and modern medicine as a quite potent form of {social control}. We will then move from a consideration of medicalization to biomedicalization; from the management of human life to transformations of ""life itself"" by way of post-World War II technoscientific interventions aimed at ""optimizing"" the vitality of individuals, groups, and entire populations. In particular, we will consider empirical case studies of technoscientific developments that have made possible the work of optimization that defines biomedicalization: molecular biology, pharmacogenomics, biotechnologies, imaging techniques (EEG, PET, and fMRI), robotics, and transplant medicine, among others. Finally, we will attend to how processes of biomedical optimization have produced new ways of seeing, knowing, and imagining human bodies, such that biology is increasingly less representative of ""destiny"" than it is of possibility.

Some feel threatened, while others are intrigued, but responses to these world regions are seldom neutral. Often seen as exotic and erotic, or as a danger to the way of life of Americans and Europeans, Islam, Arabs and Latin Americans are at the forefront of socio-political debates in the United States and Europe. The origins of this world-view are historical, but are also heavily influenced by contemporary immigration and international affairs. After characterizing Islam as the greatest contemporary threat to ""Western"" civilization in his infamous essay titled ""The Clash of Civilizations,"" Samuel Huntington subsequently found it necessary to focus on Latinos as the most significant threat to American civilization. By examining literature and film from the Middle East and Latin America, and from these immigrant communities in the United States and Europe, we will go beyond superficial images and inflammatory rhetoric to explore the cultures behind the passions. Among other things, the texts of this course examine the ties between the Arab world and Latin America, and between these two regions and their neighbors to the north. At the heart of this course are the ideas of borders and margins. What does it mean to cross borders or to live on the margins of society? The borders we will discuss will be geographic borders, but also cultural borders that will permit the exploration of the territories between life and death, civilization and barbarism, wealth and poverty, war and peace and other dichotomies that some employ to classify the world but that rarely allow for human sensibilities and the subtle experiences of being. Our texts may include works by writers such as Alurista, Victor Hernandez Cruz, Gloria Anzaldua, Juan Rulfo, Clarice Lispector, Milton Hatoum, Taher Ben Jelloun, Mohamad Choukri, Mahmoud Darwish, Laila Lalami and Tayyib Saleh that treat the human condition at the borders/margins of society.

The purpose is to provide a survey of issues in Islamic social and intellectual history from the Shi'ite margin. On that margin, Shi'ism has always been an alliance of the dispossessed and the intellectuals (assuming the latter are not among the former) and functioned in Islam to provide a vocabulary of revolution, a highly developed philosophy of religion, and a pietistic fervor in contrast to which Sunnism emerged. One consequence, intended or not, of recent U.S. actions in the Middle East has been to inflame the Sunni/Shi'ite conflicts and raise fears of Shi'ite ascendancy. But sectarian conflict is, in fact, the exception rather than the rule in Islamic history because Sunnis and Shi'a have in most places been separated or lived relatively peacefully together where they intermixed.  This is the fourth time in Islamic history when the specter of an ascendant Shi'ism has occupied the Muslim community.  This course will compare the three earlier putative episodes of Shi'ite ascendancy in the eighth (in Iraq), tenth (in Egypt) and sixteenth centuries C.E. (in Iran) and set these in conversation with contemporary developments. We will focus on the role of early Shi'ism as the vocabulary of an alternative vision of the legitimacy of the Islamic state, the ideas of the imamate and martyrdom, the emergence of Isma'ili and Twelver versions of Shi'ism, the conversion of Safavid Iran to Shi'ism, ecumencial efforts in the mid twentieth century, the Iranian revolution of 1979 and after.",lecture/discussion,evaluation based upon class participation and two short (4-6 page) essays and a final research paper (12-15 pages),none; open to all,30,15,,,meets Division 2 requirement if registration is under ARAB,,,,Division 2,,,,ARAB Arabic Studies Electives,INST Middle Eastern Studies Electives,REL Islamic Tradition Courses,,,,,,,,,LEC,,,,,,,,,,,,,Darrow,William,,,,,,,,,,,ARAB, 234,1121

This course will consider how true the King's statement still holds by evaluating the various attempts at state and nation building in the modern Middle East and the challenges of statecraft. After assessing some of the more influential theories of nationalism, we will explore the historical experience of nationalism and national identity in Iraq, Israel, Turkey, Palestine, Iran, and Egypt. What has been at the basis of nationhood? How did European concepts of nation translate into the Middle Eastern context? What was the role of religion in these modern societies? How did traditional notions of gender effect concepts of citizenship? We will also explore some of the unresolved issues facing the various nations of the Middle East, such as unfulfilled nationalist aspirations, disputes over land and borders, and challenges to sovereignty. Finally, we will evaluate the role of foreign powers in nation building in the Middle East and consider whether the modern concept of the nation has any validity in the Middle Eastern context.

We will take special interest in how modern Arab nation-states shaped their populations through migration policy: how did the construction of new national boundaries influence ethnic, religious, and political identities? Students will analyze how legal paraphernalia like passports, the census, visas, and international law made the state a stakeholder in regulating human migration. This course incorporates discussions of major migrations in the region, including the Armenian Genocide, the Greek-Turkish population transfer, Palestinian dispossession, and Arab emigration to the Americas.

From the beginnings of Christianity, pilgrims from Europe made the long journey to sacred sites in the Holy Land (extending across parts of present-day Egypt, Israel, Syria, and Turkey). When these sites became less accessible with the spread of Islam in the seventh century, Europeans sought to recreate the sites at home. Later, from 1095 onward, Christian Europeans attempted to reclaim and hold the Holy Land from non-Christians by force, through an ill-fated series of five major and several lesser ""crusades."" Over the centuries, before, during, and after the Crusades, exposure to the peoples, ideas, and cultures of the Eastern Mediterranean also came through trade and through the travel and settlement of non-Europeans in Europe itself, particularly in Spain, Sicily, and Venice.

Myth informs the visual culture of the Greeks on many levels, from paintings on vases used in domestic contexts to the marble sculpture that decorated the monumental temples of great sanctuaries throughout the Greek world. The purpose of the course is two-fold: to familiarize students with the subjects and narratives of Greek myths and the underlying belief system that, in part, produced them, and also provide a comprehensive outline of developments in Greek art in the first millenium B.C.E. Of special interest will be the techniques developed by artists for representing narratives visually, as well as the conceptual issues that underlie certain myths, such as sacrifice, war, marriage, coming of age, specific festivals, and the relationships between men and women, and those between mortals and immortals. Reading will include ancient literature in translation (Hesiod, Homer, Sappho, Aischylos, Sophokles, Euripides and Apollodorus) as well as secondary literature by contemporary authors that provides insights into the religious, social and historical developments that influenced artists in their choices of subject matter and style.

Octavian's victory at battle of Actium in 31 BCE officially brought an end to the Roman civil wars, but it did not in itself unify the empire. Out of this matrix of social fragmentation and uncertainty arose the geographical texts of the Augustan age. The genre of universal geography provided a convenient means to reconfigure identity boundaries in post-Actium world. By delineating stable borders between the peoples and provinces, geographical texts (whether written, sculptural or pictorial) literally mapped out identity boundaries and power relationships to create a new, unified image of the Roman Empire. This course examines the political and cosmological of implications geographical sources produced under the Roman Empire, including the <I>Res Gestae</I> of Augustus, Strabo's <I>Geography</I> and Tacitus' <I>Germania</I>.

Such an audacious project of collection has rarely been attempted either before or since.  At its height, the Great Library was reputed to house over 700,000 books from across the Greek world, as well as many translations of texts originally written in Latin, Hebrew, Egyptian, and even Sanskrit.  Attracted by the vast stores of knowledge, scholars, artists, and poets flocked to the Great Library to create one of the most vibrant intellectual communities the world has ever known.  In this course, we will examine the development and influence of the Great Library and its sister institution, the Mouseion (or ""Museum"") from a variety of cultural and historical perspectives.  We will begin by exploring the political motives of the Ptolemaic kings and their reception of earlier traditions of collecting in the Greek and Near Eastern worlds.  We will then turn to the intellectual and artistic activity at the Library itself, with special attention to the development of notions of connoisseurship and canon across various disciplines.  Although implicated in the Ptolemies' political agenda, the scholars living and working in the Great Library were granted extraordinary freedom to pursue new ideas that transformed literature, science, and the arts forever.  Readings will include selections from Theocritus' <I>Idylls</I>, Apollonius' <I>Argonautica</I> and Eratothenes' <I>Geography</I>.  Finally, we will examine the legacy of the Great Library from the Roman empire to the present day, focusing particularly on how the concept of a universal archive has shaped the collecting practices of everything from modern art museums and Google Books to such governmental entities as the NSA.  <I>All readings are in translation</I>.",lecture,"evaluation will be based on classroom performance, three response papers, one 12- to 15-page paper, and a midterm exam",none,30,20,"preference given to majors or prospective majors in Classics, History, and Comparative Literature",meets Division 1 requirement if registration is under CLAS or COMP; meets Division 2 requirement if registration is under HIST,,,,,Division 1,,,,HIST Group C Electives - Europe and Russia,HIST Group G Electives - Premodern,,,,,,,,,01,LEC,TF,01:10,02:25,,,,,,,,,,Rubin,Benjamin,,,,,,,,,,,ARTH, 283,1153

Indeed, the modern notion of the visual artist as a brooding, even tortured genius of unstoppable creative force finds its roots in the Italian Renaissance. This is largely due to the singular figure of Michelangelo, whose life and career are more fully documented than those of any western artist to precede him. And Michelangelo's mythic individuality, alongside his artistic innovations and contributions, have made him a fundamental force in the shape of the history of art as we understand and study it today. Students of this tutorial will become well-acquainted with the life and work of Michelangelo through the examination of a wide variety of primary and secondary sources: contemporary Renaissance documents, letters, poetry, andbiographies; art historical surveys, monographs, and studies; and documentary and popular film. They will give their critical attention, however, to the intersection between this artist's biography and his artistic production. We will focus on a number of important questions arising from this connection. What, for example, is the nature and reliability of the evidence used to reconstruct Michelangelo's life and personality? What are the grounds for interpreting his work according to his philosophical outlook, religious beliefs, and even sexuality? To what extent was Michelangelo responsible for shaping his own persona for posterity? Is the myth of this artist distinguishable from his reality?

During the period, broad  cultural transformations contributed to a shift in viewing conditions for objects. The circulation of visitors throughout Europe, as the Grand Tour reached its peak, the abundance of archaeological excavations that flooded new works on the market, and the movement of works of art themselves as part of the art market and military conquest meant that viewers encountered objects directly on a scale as never before. This broadening audience for art merged with multiple arenas for spectatorship. Displays and exhibitions in a wide variety of locations-- domestic spaces, artists' studios, gardens, churches and, significantly, newly founded museums--merged with carefully thought out exhibition techniques to engage viewers visually and physically with objects. Artists and collectors paid close attention to lighting, pedestals, frames, juxtapositions between objects, and even architectural frameworks. All of these techniques contributed to the meanings visitors extracted from objects.
Whenever possible the class will draw on primary sources, including tourist and travel narratives from the period and works of art that show objects in situ. Case studies will range from the spaces
of display, such as the princely collections in Italy to the public museum of the Louvre, the display strategies of specific artists, such as Canova and David, and the changing fortunes of particular works of art, such as the <I>Apollo Belvedere</I> and Raphael's <I>Transfiguration</I>. Topics of discussion will not only include the exhibition strategies used by patrons and collectors, but also the way display techniques could elicit a variety of reactions on the part of viewers, including personal reflection, political commentary and aesthetic discourse. The course will also contribute to a broader understanding of the history of collecting and museums.",seminar,"class attendance, participation and an 8-10 page research paper, divided into multiple components, including an annotated bibliography, paper outline, rough draft, peer review, 10-minute in-class presentation, final draft and 250-word abstract",none,12,10,"Art history majors, with preference given to upperclassmen",,,,,,Division 1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01,SEM,R,01:10,03:50,,,,,,,,,,Ferando,Christina,,,,,,,,,,,ARTH, 400,1153

The current trend towards countermonuments, or anti-monuments, such as Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial or the Gerzes' vanishing ""Monument Against Fascism, War and Violence and For Peace and Human Rights"" in Hamburg/Harburg will be discussed in light of the monumental tradition of combining word, image, and architecture to create memorials that will endure in both spatial and temporal terms.

This course will investigate how gender as a cultural and social construction is visualized in Chinese art.  Issues of interest include how gendered space is constructed in Chinese painting; how landscape paintings can be decoded as masculine or feminine; and ways in which images of women help construct ideas of both femininity and masculinity.  This course will also discuss Confucian literati's [ideals] [of] reclusion and homsociality; didactic art for women; images of concubines, courtesans; and lonely women's isolation and abandonment.  For example, while nature is often seen as feminine, Chinese landscape painting may be coded as masculine due to its association with the Confucian scholar' ideals of eremitism, a means for the cultivation of the mind, and homosociality.  On the other hand, the placement of a masculine landscape in feminine space may be seen as rhetorical strategy, accentuating the lonely woman's isolation and abandonment, which are important tropes in Chinese erotic poetry as well.  
This course fulfills the EDI requirement in that it is designed to enable students to study the logic of gender and sexuality in a context different from their own; to see how both genders are constructed in relation to each other, and how they interact in the context of class, ideology, politics, and ideals, as well as how we may compare their representation in China with those of other cultures, notably Japan and the West.

The seminar will also focus on the ways in which earth has been used in contemporary art towards addressing the growing problems of pollution, unsustainable development, and the widespread depletion of earth-based natural resources in Africa. Over the course of this seminar, students will develop a knowledge base of earth-related issues that have been addressed in African artistic production, and engage with various cross-disciplinary methodologies to critically analyze the conceptual and aesthetic strategies deployed in these works.

One of the most innovative and dramatic aspects of this new language was its assimilation of monumental sculpture, absent in Europe since the fifth century. The focus of attention in this regard was the portal, which marked the threshold between the profane realm of the outside world and the sacred space of the church. Often characterized as the ""marquee of the Middle Ages,"" the Romanesque sculpted portal, with its startling juxtaposition of the spiritual and the physical, of ecstatic visions of the heavenly realm and writhing, biting monsters, constitutes one of the true high-points of medieval art. This seminar will investigate the antecedents and origins of the Romanesque sculpted portal and examine in detail its greatest manifestations. Emphasis will be placed on understanding these often complex sculptural schemes within their original functional and physical contexts. What role did this three-dimensional imagery play in structuring the medieval visitor's overall experience of the church?

If modernist painting has often been understood to put pressure on existing power relations, the stylistic innovation that defines it has just as often been used to veil its controversial subject matter. The aim of this course is two-fold: 1) to call attention to difference through comparative analysis and to consider how and why identifying it is meaningful; 2) to detail the changes in historiography since the 1970s that have enabled discussions of difference (sex, class, race, ethnicity, sexuality) and the challenges they present. The course demonstrates that the Second Empire (1851-1870) in France was an especially fertile period for innovations in style and subject matter that generated both outrage and incomprehension. In the wake of the revolution of 1848, realism and its rallying cry (""il faut être de son temps"") brought home subjects that heretofore had been safely displaced to the classical or exotic worlds as they were imagined by the West. The Second Empire coincided with the birth of mass culture so that artists had access to new types of imagery and increasing contact with racy and controversial subjects. 
This course will investigate polemical works by Gustave Courbet (i.e. Burial at Ornans, Origin of the World) and Edouard Manet (i.e. Olympia, The Execution of Emperor Maximilian) through the lens of critical writings of the 1850s and 1860s (i.e. Baudelaire, Proudhon, Zola) as well as revisionist writings from the 1970s to the present (Homi Bhahba, T.J. Clark, Richard Dyer, Michael Fried, Tamar Garb, Sander Gilman, Zine Magubane, Linda Nochlin, and Gayatri Spivak). We will consider the relationship of Manet's and Courbet's works to academic ones, including orientalist paintings by Ingres and Gérôme, and to vanguard pictures of the next generation (i.e. the homoerotic work of Caillebotte and Bazille, the ""sex workers"" of Degas's toilette scenes). Finally, we will examine the legacy of Courbet and Manet during the period when difference began to be represented in the work of artists such as Judy Chicago, Yasumasa Morimura, Cindy Sherman, Samuel Fosso, and Carrie Mae Weems.",seminar,"weekly 1- to 2-page position papers; oral presentation and final research paper, 10-15 pages",ARTH 101-102 or permission of instructor,12,12,"students with course work in French history or literature and/or Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies",,meets Division 1 requirement if registration is under ARTH; meets Division 2 requirement if registration is under WGSS,,,,Division 1,Exploring Diversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEM,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ockman,Carol,,,,,,,,,,,ARTH, 426,1141

For today's artist form itself is the content."" These remarks of the German critic Paul Westheim, published in 1919, sound strange today, yet they express an attitude that dominated critical and historical writing on modern art for most of the twentieth century. Although questions of ""meaning"" have become more central to art-historical writing of the last four decades, there is a surprising dearth of methodological discussion on this issue. No compelling models, comparable to that offered by Erwin Panofsky in his classic introduction to <I>Studies in Iconology</I>, have established themselves for modern and contemporary art, and many interpretations proceed on the basis of anachronistic methodological assumptions. Moreover, the study of <I>how</I> artworks communicate or otherwise affect us still remains relatively little studied beyond individual cases. This seminar will explore the problem of ""meaning"" in modern and contemporary art and examine various models for dealing with the issue, including iconography, semiotics, reception theory, and affect theory.

Kingdoms replaced city-states as important centers of power. Increased trade and movement of individuals between Greece, Egypt and the Near and Middle East, encouraged a cross-cultural examination of religion, philosophy, literature and art. The new cosmopolitan attitude brought about not only a revolution in sculptural ideals and forms but in the approach towards art in general. Museums and libraries are established for the first time, and the concept of collecting art takes hold. We see a historical self-consciousness, and a self-referential quality in sculpture and painting as well as a new interest in theatricality and the diversity of human nature and experience.  This course will explore Hellenistic sculpture and painting through the close study of individual works of art of the fourth through first centuries B.C.E., as well as the broader philosophical, religious, literary and political forces that encouraged its innovations.

For today's artist form itself is the content."" These remarks of the German critic Paul Westheim, published in 1919, sound strange today, yet they express an attitude that dominated critical and historical writing on modern art for most of the twentieth century. Although questions of ""meaning"" have become more central to art-historical writing of the last four decades, there is a surprising dearth of methodological discussion on this issue. No compelling models, comparable to that offered by Erwin Panofsky in his classic introduction to <I>Studies in Iconology</I>, have established themselves for modern and contemporary art, and many interpretations proceed on the basis of anachronistic methodological assumptions. Moreover, the study of <I>how</I> artworks communicate or otherwise affect us still remains relatively little studied beyond individual cases. This seminar will explore the problem of ""meaning"" in modern and contemporary art and examine various models for dealing with the issue, including iconography, semiotics, reception theory, and affect theory.

Students will develop their own video, performance, or written work in this vein. The course will give special consideration to particular forms of artist-made film and video: the essay film, activist/grassroots/social media, and performance-based and narrative media that reflect on historical events and the ongoing present. We will look at a variety of work, including: Fiona Banner, Catherine Bigelow, Wafaa Bilal, Nao Bustamante, Paul Chan, Adam Curtis, Jean-Luc Godard, Danny Glover, Dara Greenwald, Sharon Hayes, Spike Lee, Zoe Leonard, Chris Marker, Alain Resnais, Anna Deveare Smith, Lisa Steele, Agnes Varda, The Yes Men, Haskell Wexler, and collectives including ACT UP, Pink Bloque, TVTV, and Occupy Wall Street.

Games communicate the experience of embodying a role by manipulating the player's own decisions, abstraction, and discrete planning. Those three elements are the essence of computation, which makes computer science theory integral to game design. Video games also co-opt programming and computer graphics as new tools for the modern artist. As a result, games are collaborative interdisciplinary constructs that use computation as a medium for creative expression. Students analyze and extend contemporary video and board games using the methodology of science and the language of the arts. They explore how computational concepts like recursion, state, and complexity apply to interactive experiences. They then synthesize new game elements using mathematics, programming and both digital and traditional art tools. Emphasis is on the theory of design in modern European board games.

In the 1960s the Judson Dance Theater and other dance makers often took cues from their colleagues in visual art and music. Today there is a renewed interest in the body and performance in gallery and museum contexts while at the same time the contemporary dance world is re-visiting interdisciplinary sensibilities and techniques, newly challenging how ""dance"" can be defined. Stillness and quotidian action are again being framed as choreography, dancers are using technology and materials to create visual and sonic products from their movements, obsessively repetitive actions and physical exhaustion and endurance, trends long popular in live art/performance, are being re-contextualized by choreographers and/or in traditional theatrical settings, dance and dancers are regularly performing outside of traditional theaters, and projects featuring humans moving in collaboration with urban and natural environments are commonplace.
Dismissing the need to determine weather or not a given performance is in fact dance, this course proposes the reclamation of the word choreography to include any movement (or stillness) of bodies in space and time. Expanding definitions of choreography, the class calls on compositional techniques from dance as well as strategies not traditionally considered for application to choreography. Through in-class experiential exercises, readings, video and performance viewing (of contemporary and historical work by well-known and lesser-known artists), discussion, and individual performance-making, the class will employ several interdisciplinary ways of inventing and organizing movement, a handful of approaches to how a maker transmits ideas to a performer, and a variety of examples of how and for what purpose an artist frames these particular actions and inactions in a given context. We will look at a number of works categorized within the field of dance, while also considering examples from live/performance art, conceptual practice, music/sound, installation and sculpture. Students will make several performances, working on their own as solo performers, as directors of group projects, and as a collaborative team of makers.",studio,"class participation, regular written and choreographic assignments, and final research/performance project","expierence in dance, theater, performance, video or literary arts",10,10,juniors and seniors; if over enrolled instructor may ask for statement of interest,,,,,,Division 1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,STU,,,,,,,,,,,,,van der Kolk,Hana,,,,,,,,,,,ARTS, 302,1141

We are made aware of things appearing (or disappearing) by the degrees and kinds of contrasts exhibited by the subject (ideas or objects) in relation to its ground (ephemeral or material). The particular array of relationships between subject and ground constructs diverse kinds of evidence.
Intellectual inquiries have consistently determined, through different arguments and for different conclusions, the specificity and reliability of visible or invisible evidence. In any aggregate analysis, the sciences, art, philosophy, religion and social sciences have repeatedly encountered the significance of the subject as it appears or disappears. From medical research in the imaging processes of the internal body to the forensic cues offered by the ""black box"" in-flight recording; from the use of camouflage to the drone-recorded sightings of friend and foe; from the inability of an eating disorder patient to recognize a self image to the masquerades we willingly wear-appearance and disappearance have governed the evidences of our actions, beliefs and identities. 
This image-based studio examination of the subject will look at material that has been shaped by its link with our central theme. Each of five studio projects will successively build a cumulative view of how appearance and/or disappearance might shift a viewer's ability to render any point of view.

One of the aims of this course is to challenge traditional notions and expectations of narrative. For instance, what could minimally constitute a narrative piece? How do different mediums allow for time to unfold in unexpected ways? How does omission play a powerful role in a narrative? How might the role of the narrator (often so powerful and present in novels and short stories) change in a visual arts context?

This course deconstructs the historic roots and ongoing causal factors that produce structural violence against women and religious minorities in modern India.  It highlights the social practices that have produced critical axes of difference around the themes of religion, gender, and sexuality using key moments or regions of India as points of departure.  It contrasts the explosive effects of religion, gender, and caste during the tragedy of Partition with the ongoing production of communal and gender-based violence in India today, using Kashmir and New Delhi as microcosms for our study. We will consider the ways that multiple subjectivities and polarized identities intersect with individual agency to produce a social landscape of hierarchy and conflict across India today.  We are also interested in the socio-cultural forces that reproduce or shore up these binaries as much as third terms or middle paths that attempt to transcend or diffuse them.

Throughout the course, we consider the central role of the complex interaction between Buddhism and politics in Tibetan history, both in the pre-modern period and in more recent times, when the Tibetan people have faced the challenge of how to use their institutions and culture to resist oppression. In this way, we get a footing in the Tibetan world, and the indispensable assessment of Western representations of Tibet becomes not just an exercise in self-reflection but also a gate to a better understanding of a remarkable but tragically threatened civilization.

How do bodies come to signify the purity or prosperity of the nation or community and with what social or discursive effects? We begin by unpacking foundational theories of the body as proposed by Mauss, Foucault, Douglas, and Bourdieu in order to better understand how local discourses of the body help produce gender and other social hierarchies in South Asia. By considering how the human body can serve as a map for society and vice versa, we examine both classical discourses and modern institutional practices of the body including the temple, the monastery, the mosque, and the mendicant, as well as bodily practices such as yoga, celibacy, sex work, and new reproductive technologies.

Most generally, it considers the myriad ways that Buddhist soteriology and practice produce the very gender differences they purport to overcome. How have the Buddha and his far-flung disciples institutionalized gender differences in spite of their putative goal of transcending duality? We examine the varying experiences of women and men in Buddhist societies and literatures as a lens by which to analyze the pervasive operation of social and gender hierarchies.  Last but not least, we discuss how well feminist and American revisions of Buddhism have transformed gender and other forms of difference.  Our analysis revolves around several interdependent themes. (1) How do female and male bodies become the subject of a specific set of Buddhist gazes? What does Buddhist discourse say about the possibility of gaining enlightenment in the female body? (2) How do gender divisions reflect deeper social divisions such as class and race in Buddhist discourse? (3) How have feminist deconstructions of Buddhism transformed gender and social hierarchies in the contemporary world?

Such beliefs are blamed for ""tribal"" violence in Pakistan's Frontier Regions, for dowry disputes in north India and for the persistence of corrupt dynasties in leading political parties. Yet these beliefs and practices aren't in fact old-fashioned or lawless, and many of them result from South Asia's unique historical position as a former British colony. In this class, we will use ethnographic and historical research to examine what law and kinship can teach us about how the past shapes the present in post-colonial South Asia. In particular, we'll examine how a perspective that seriously considers law and kinship can help us better understand contemporary dilemmas in South Asia, ranging from controversy over women¿s right to inherit property, to the role of caste in contemporary democratic politics. The course is organized into three sections. First, we will discuss kinship, reading classic theories of kinship in the region, as well as critiques of those theories, and ending with a contemporary dilemma, the problem of dowry ""pressure"". Next, we learn about how family relationships were codified legally, and how laws were shaped to respond to perceived family ""traditions,"" in colonial and post-colonial South Asia.

This course will look first at the history of the Afghan and Pakistani states and of the Pushtun and Baluchi tribes that are part of, yet independent from the states that surround them. We will go on to consider the role of Islam as a political force in the region, with particular emphasis on the ways in which outside religious groups, most recently al-Qaeda, have managed to gain a foothold in the borderlands, despite the historic resistance of the tribes to outsiders of any kind. The course will also examine the efforts of, first, the Soviet Union in the 1980s and, more recently, the United States and its allies to control the borderlands, and we will conclude with a consideration of the geopolitical implications if Afghanistan and Pakistan prove in the end to be ""failed states.""

It is imagined as existing in historic seclusion, and, following the establishment of the People's Republic, as pursuing a path of autarky. Such separation has then only been somewhat modified by the set of economic reforms that Deng Xiaoping first instituted in the late 1970s. In this seminar we will seek to turn such conventional wisdom on its head through examining the role that transnational actors have played in shaping the course of modern Chinese politics. However, the course's primary focus will not be upon the past, but rather the present.  More specifically, it will concentrate on the recent rise of a new class of Chinese transnational public intellectuals who have recently risen to prominence within the PRC.  It will also seek to identify the influence such individuals are having upon not only their fields of expertise, but also upon broader Chinese debates about collective identity and the country's place in a rapidly changing international system. Coming to terms with such issues will provide those who enroll in the seminar with a deeper, more nuanced, understanding of China's rise and this trend's implications for the rest of the world.

Key issues include how various Japanese have tried to make sense of death and personal sacrifice in the name of a lost war; the implications of Japan's unique position as both perpetrator of wartime atrocities and victim of atomic bombings; the relationship between memory and nationalism; and what it means to come to terms with pasts contested both within and between countries.",tutorial; students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week; a student either will write and present orally a 5- to 7-page essay on the assigned readings or be responsible for offering an oral critique of the work of their partner;,"students will be evaluated on these essays and critiques, and there will be a final paper (12-15 pages) on the themes of the course",none; open to all,10,10,"History and Asian Studies majors, and then to students who have taken courses in History or Asian Studies",,,may not be taken on a pass/fail basis; not available for the Gaudino option,,,Division 2,,,Writing Intensive,HIST Group B Electives - Asia,,,,,,,,,,,TUT,,,,,,,,,,,,,Siniawer,Eiko,,,,,,,,,,,ASST, 486,1141

Gandhi, one of the most influential thinkers of the non-western world.  Gandhi is well known today for his philosophy of non-violence and its application in India's freedom struggle as well as his influence on the work of leaders like Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela. Hailed as the `father of the Indian nation', however, Gandhi is not only known for his political ideas but also for his deep engagement with aspect of everyday human behavior and morality: truth, vegetarianism, sex and celibacy, to name just a few of his obsessive concerns which contributed to making his broader philosophy. It is this commitment to a morally pure life that earned him the title of `Mahatma' or Great Soul in India. 
The tutorial will focus on three key aspects of Gandhi: his ideas of nationalism, his contemplations on moral philosophy and on his legacy in modern India. The materials will include a combination of Gandhi's own writings as well as journal articles, monographs and films. The course will probe questions such as: What was the nature of Gandhian nationalism? Did it help to integrate the Indian nation? How, if at all, was shaped by Gandhi's engagements with moral philosophy and human behavior? Was Gandhi truly a Great Soul, a saint or a shrewd politician? In what ways is Gandhi received and remembered by the Indian nation today? How does understanding a figure like Gandhi facilitate our understanding of modern nationalism, citizenship and political action?",tutorial; students will meet with the instructor each week for one hour sessions in pairs,every other week each student will write and orally present a 5- to 7-page essay on the assigned readings of that week; students not presenting an essay will write and present 2 page critique of their partners' work.,none,10,10,History majors,,,may not be taken on a pass/fail basis; not available for the Gaudino option,,,Division 2,Exploring Diversity,,Writing Intensive,HIST Group B Electives - Asia,INST South + Southeast Asia Studies Electives,,,,,,,,,T1,TUT,TBA,,,,,,,,,,,,Kapadia,Aparna,,,,,,,,,,,ASST, 488,1153

It is, however, a notion that is more fiction than fact, one story of many that can be told about the area we now call China. This course is organized around a number of topics ranging across different periods and cultures in China, including the following: language, protest, order (and disorder), commerce, the supernatural, reclusion, individualism, and beauty. Lectures and discussions will focus on texts from a wide range of time periods and genres, from ancient poems to modern films, from Buddhist sutras to the writings of Mao Zedong.  This course functions as an EDI course in a number of ways.

But equally surprising are the intriguing differences that lie concealed within that sameness. This course investigates Japanese culture and compares it with our own by reading Japanese fiction about two universal human experiences--love and death--and asking what inflections Japanese writers give these ideas in their work. The course begins with tales of doomed lovers that were popular in the eighteenth-century kabuki and puppet theaters, and that still feature prominently in Japanese popular culture, from comics to TV dramas. From there we move on to novels and films that examine a range of other relationships between love and death, including parental love and sacrifice, martyrdom and love of country, sex and the occult, and romance at an advanced age.

We will begin by looking into the Heian period (794-1185), when the work of female authors occupied center stage and some of the canonical texts of the Japanese literary and cultural tradition were born. Next we will consider the medieval period (1185-1600), which saw the rise of the samurai class and the consequent shift in the domain of artistic creation. Then we will look at the Edo period (1600-1867), when a new bourgeois culture flourished and audiences were greatly transformed. We will also explore the continuing force of premodern literary traditions in contemporary performing arts. <I>All readings and discussions will be in English.</I> ",lecture/discussion,"active class participation, presentations, written journals, two essay questions, one paper, and attendance of live performance events",none; open to all,15,15,,,,,,,Division 1,,,,INST East Asian Studies Electives,PERF Interdepartmental Electives,,,,,,,,,,LEC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAPN, 276,1113

Stars are accompanied by diffuse matter all through their lifetimes, from their birthplaces in dense molecular clouds, to the stellar winds they eject with varying ferocity as they evolve, to their final fates as they shed their outer layers, whether as planetary nebulae or dazzling supernovae. As these processes go on, they enrich the interstellar medium with the products of the stars' nuclear fusion. The existence of life on Earth is eloquent evidence of this chemical enrichment. In this course we will study the interstellar medium in its various forms. We will discuss many of the physical mechanisms that produce the radiation we observe from diffuse matter, including radiative ionization and recombination, collisional excitation of ""forbidden"" lines, collisional ionization, and synchrotron radiation. This course is observing-intensive.

In this course we will discuss the most important observations that lead us to these conclusions. We will start by studying and classifying galaxies.

We will discuss observational data that support the Big Bang model, concentrating on the microwave background radiation and its properties, along with the process of primordial nucleosynthesis. Recent observational data indicate that at a very early stage of evolution the universe passed through a phase of very rapid exponential expansion called ""inflation.""

Tropical issues have become prominent on a global scale, and many social issues in the tropics are inextricably bound to human ecology, evolution, and physiology.  The course begins with a survey of the tropical environment of humans, including major climatic and habitat features.  The next section focuses on human population biology, and emphasizes demography and the role of disease particularly malaria and AIDS.  The final part of the course covers the place of human societies in local and global ecosystems including the challenges of tropical food production, the importance of organic diversity, and the interaction of humans with their supporting ecological environment.

This information can be used to illuminate human history and evolution. It can also be used in the field of medicine to develop new drugs and as a first step toward tailoring treatments to match individuals' genomes. This information can also create new ethical and social dilemmas. Do such studies support or refute the idea of a biological basis for 'race'? Can the data be used to justify societal inequities? Do the data have any use outside of scientific circles? Through reading scientific articles we'll explore genome sequencing data to determine the types of DNA differences that exist among humans. We'll examine the data in the light of human population history (migration, population bottlenecks, selection) to understand how these variations come about. Throughout we'll discuss the implications of these studies for individuals and for society. In particular we'll critique the use of such information in guiding policy and practice in areas such as genetic screening and eugenics, ancestry testing, 'race-based' medicine, forensics.

The tension between these two inputs is particularly apparent in the developing nervous system, where many events must be predetermined, and where plasticity, or altered outcomes in response to environmental conditions, is also essential. Plasticity is reduced as development and differentiation proceed, and the potential for regeneration after injury or disease in adults is limited; however some exceptions to this rule exist, and recent data suggest that the nervous system is not hard-wired as previously thought.

Muscle plays a major role in metabolic regulation of organisms, acts as a glucose storage facility, regulates blood pressure in mammals, and produces numerous hormones. The mechanism for contractile activity varies not only among different organisms, but also among different muscles within the same organism. Controversies, disagreements, and arguments pervade the muscle biology literature perhaps because of the integrative nature of the science. In this tutorial course, we will utilize molecular, physiological, comparative, and evolutionary aspects of muscle biology to address current controversies of this dynamic tissue. Some questions that will be addressed include: 1) Lactic acid generated by skeletal muscle is / is not involved with fatigue at high exercise intensity, 2) Satellite cells are / are not obligatory for skeletal muscle hypertrophy, 3) Do mammals possess the same ""stretch activation"" of skeletal muscle as seen in insect flight muscle?, 4) Are smooth and skeletal muscles from the same lineage of cells, or do they represent convergent evolution on the tissue level?

These include: (1) the scientific and technological foundation for the examination of physical, chemical, and biological items of evidence, and (2) the scope of expert qualifications and testimony, the legal status of scientific techniques, and the admissibility of the results in evidence. The analysis of trace evidence, including glass, soil, gunpowder residues and bullet fragments, and inorganic and heavy metal poisons are discussed through an understanding of the basic concepts of chemistry and analytical chemistry. Forensic toxicology and pharmacology are applied to the analysis of alcohol, poisons, and drugs based upon the principles of organic chemistry and biochemistry. The characterization of blood and other body fluids necessitate an understanding of serology and molecular genetics. The cases which stimulate the exploration of these areas include: the John and Robert Kennedy assassinations, the Jeffrey MacDonald case (<I>Fatal Vision</I>), the Wayne Williams case, the deaths of celebrities Marilyn Monroe, John Belushi, and Janis Joplin, the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin, the Lindberg baby kidnapping, the Tylenol poisonings, and the identity of Anastasia.
An interactive laboratory program provides an appreciation of scientific experimentation in general and the work of a crime lab in particular.

In this course, we will take advantage of one well-studied system, the highly conserved Ras-related family of proteins, which play a central role in numerous fundamental processes within the cell. The course will integrate bioinformatics and molecular biology, using database searching, alignments and pattern matching, phylogenetics, and recombinant DNA techniques to reconstruct the evolution of gene families by focusing on the gene duplication events and gene rearrangements that have occurred over the course of eukaryotic speciation. By utilizing high through-put approaches to investigate genes involved in the MAPK signal transduction pathway in human colon cancer cell lines, students will uncover regulatory mechanisms that are aberrantly altered by siRNA knockdown of putative regulatory components. This functional genomic strategy will be coupled with independent projects using phosphorylation-state specific antisera to test our hypotheses. Proteomic analysis will introduce the students to de novo structural prediction and threading algorithms, as well as data-mining approaches and Bayesian modeling of protein network dynamics in single cells.

Do all toxic materials exert their effect in the same manner, or can materials be poisonous in a variety of different ways? Are the safety levels set by regulatory agencies low enough for a range of common toxic materials, such as mercury, lead, and certain pesticides?

This discourse of ""The Trojan War"" attained a remarkable coherence yet also thrived on substantial variations and changes over the 300-400 years of Greek literature we will explore, a dynamic of change and continuity that has persisted through the more than two millenia of subsequent Greek, Roman, Western, and non-Western participation in this discourse.

This course explores the ancient Romans' own interpretations of their past, their present, and their destiny: the humble beginnings of their city, its rise to supreme world power, and premonitions of its decline. Related topics for our consideration will include Roman constructions of gender, the location and expression of virtue in the public and private spheres, the connections and conflicts between moral probity and political success, the exercise of individual power versus action on behalf of the commonwealth, the absorption of foreign customs and peoples into Rome, the management of literal and imaginary frontiers, and other anxieties of empire.

First of all, Greek thinkers, especially Plato and Aristotle, radically shaped the trajectory of western thought in every area of philosophy. No one can have an adequate understanding of western intellectual history without some familiarity with the Greeks, and we might think that an understanding of our intellectual history can deepen our understanding of our own situation. More importantly, many of the thinkers that we will read in this class are simply excellent philosophers, and it is worthwhile for anyone interested in philosophical problems to read treatments of these problems by excellent philosophers. We will begin the course by looking briefly at some of the Presocratic philosophers active in the Mediterranean world of the seventh through fifth centuries BCE, and some of the sophists active in the fifth century. We will then turn to several of Plato's dialogues, examining Plato's portrayal of Socrates and his development of a new and profoundly powerful philosophical conception.

This course will explore the rich and varied literary traditions associated with the primeval history in the Genesis. Through a close reading of ancient noncanonical sources such as the Book of Enoch, Jubilees, and the Life of Adam and Eve, as well as Jewish traditions represented in Josephus, Philo, and Rabbinic literature and other accounts presented in early Christian and Gnostic texts, we will investigate the ways in which the elliptical style of Genesis generated a massive body of ancient folklore, creative exegesis, and explicit literary re-imagining of the early history of humankind.

We start with the origin of the writings before they became collected into the New Testament, and ask: what forms of writings (genres) in Greco-Roman culture were available to the authors of the new scriptures, and how they were used for the purpose of shaping faith in Jesus Christ and creating communities? Why just these scriptures were included, and not others, for instance, the Gospel of Thomas, is another much discussed question. The impact of the New Testament writings upon society is a problematic history; for instance, they have been used to support negative attitudes to Jews, women and homosexuals. This raises the issue of how to read the New Testament. There are many different ways of reading the New Testament; perhaps the most common way to read it is as Scripture, important for one's religious faith. In this course, however, we will focus on scholarly and academic readings of the New Testament. But they, too, have gone through many changes, influenced by contemporary methods, e.g. historical-critical ones in the 19th and into 20th century, more recently, by literary, feminist and post-colonial readings.

These include portraiture, panegyric poetry, ritual processions, royal autobiography and monumental architecture, e.g., the Great Pyramids in Egypt and the Pantheon in Rome.  We will also study the reception of royal art and ideology among the king's subjects.

We will also read short selections from (or read about) the genres out of which tragedy and comedy were created and re-created, and into which they sometimes made their own incursions (e.g., heroic epic, women's laments, choral and solo lyric poetry, wisdom poetry, oratory, philosophical texts, histories, mime, farce, various kinds of dance, music and visual arts). We will especially attend to the ways tragedy and comedy inflected one another.

Such an audacious project of collection has rarely been attempted either before or since.  At its height, the Great Library was reputed to house over 700,000 books from across the Greek world, as well as many translations of texts originally written in Latin, Hebrew, Egyptian, and even Sanskrit.  Attracted by the vast stores of knowledge, scholars, artists, and poets flocked to the Great Library to create one of the most vibrant intellectual communities the world has ever known.  In this course, we will examine the development and influence of the Great Library and its sister institution, the Mouseion (or ""Museum"") from a variety of cultural and historical perspectives.  We will begin by exploring the political motives of the Ptolemaic kings and their reception of earlier traditions of collecting in the Greek and Near Eastern worlds.  We will then turn to the intellectual and artistic activity at the Library itself, with special attention to the development of notions of connoisseurship and canon across various disciplines.  Although implicated in the Ptolemies' political agenda, the scholars living and working in the Great Library were granted extraordinary freedom to pursue new ideas that transformed literature, science, and the arts forever.  Readings will include selections from Theocritus' <I>Idylls</I>, Apollonius' <I>Argonautica</I> and Eratothenes' <I>Geography</I>.  Finally, we will examine the legacy of the Great Library from the Roman empire to the present day, focusing particularly on how the concept of a universal archive has shaped the collecting practices of everything from modern art museums and Google Books to such governmental entities as the NSA.  <I>All readings are in translation</I>.",lecture,"evaluation will be based on classroom performance, three response papers, one 12- to 15-page paper, and a midterm exam",none,30,20,"preference given to majors or prospective majors in Classics, History, and Comparative Literature",meets Division 1 requirement if registration is under CLAS or COMP; meets Division 2 requirement if registration is under HIST,,,,,Division 1,,,,HIST Group C Electives - Europe and Russia,HIST Group G Electives - Premodern,,,,,,,,,01,LEC,TF,01:10,02:25,,,,,,,,,,Rubin,Benjamin,,,,,,,,,,,CLAS, 283,1153

Apparently he corrupted the youth by engaging with them in philosophy. In this class, we will attempt to carry on the noble tradition of corruption by philosophy. We will read works by three of Socrates' contemporaries: Aristophanes, Xenophon, and especially Plato. Through an examination of these works, we will try to get some feeling for what Socrates' controversial positions and his arguments for these positions may have been. While he never wrote any philosophical works of his own, Socrates is one of the most influential thinkers in the western tradition. His thought influenced the thought of subsequent generations of philosophers. In fact, Socrates seems to have been thought of as a kind of intellectual saint in the Hellenistic world. The stoics and skeptics both claimed a Socratic imprimatur for their own thought. Stoicism and skepticism, however, are wildly divergent schools of thought. How could proponents of each be claiming to follow in the footsteps of Socrates? We will read some representative works from each of these schools of thought to see how each approaches Socrates. If time permits, we may also look at how the figure of Socrates has been thought about in the works of more modern thinkers.",tutorial,five tutorial papers and a final paper,none,10,10,first- and second-year students; some preference will be given to prospective Philosophy and Classics majors,meets History requirement only if registration is under PHIL,meets Division 1 requirement if registration is under CLAS; meets Division 2 requirement if registration is under PHIL,may not be taken on a pass/fail basis,,,Division 2,,,Writing Intensive,PHIL History Courses,,,,,,,,,,,TUT,,,,,,,,,,,,,McPartland,Keith,,,,,,,,,,,CLAS, 289,1133

The philosophers of ancient Greece and Rome were among the first thinkers to develop rigorous arguments in response to such musings. Much of the moral philosophy produced in Greece and Rome remains as relevant today as when it was written. In this course, we will examine some central texts in ancient Greek and Roman moral philosophy. We will begin by reading some of Plato's early dialogues and his Republic. We will then turn to Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. We will then examine writings in the Stoic and Epicurean traditions, as well as Cicero's <I>On the Ends of Good and Evil.</I> As we proceed through the course, we will look at the way in which each thinker characterizes happiness, virtue and the relation between the two.

The power of song to alter the mental and physical states of the audience and the world at large is intertwined with the wide variety of uses to which ancient magic was applied. Similarly, the idea of divine or supernatural inspiration can be interpreted as a reflexive enchantment that binds the poet to the transformative power of language. This tutorial course will explore the fundamental ways in which ancient Greek and Roman poetry, and its later offspring, are configured and understood as a kind of enchantment or incantation. By examining works that explicitly depict acts of enchantment as well as those that represent themselves as spells, dreams, charms, and curses, we will attempt to understand the structural and semantic relationships between song and magic across several genres. We will also consider the role of inspiration, enthusiasm, memory, truth, and falsehood in shaping both the poems themselves and discourses about poetry. Finally, we will investigate the reception and elaboration of these concepts in later European poetic traditions from the middle ages through modernity.

But placing leaders in their much less easily encapsulated political, social, and religious contexts reveals them to be far more complicated and challenging subjects. Among the questions that will guide our study of Greek leadership: Was the transformative leader in a Greek city always an unexpected one, arising outside of the prevailing political and/or social systems? To what extent did the prevailing systems determine the nature of transformative as well as of normative leadership? How did various political and social norms contribute to legitimating particular kinds of leader? After studying such leaders as the ""tyrants"" who prevailed in many Greek cities of both the archaic and classical eras, then Athenian leaders like Solon, Cleisthenes, Cimon, Pericles,  Cleon, and Demosthenes, and Spartans like Cleomenes, Leonidas, Brasidas, and Lysander, we will focus on Alexander the Great, whose unique accomplishments transformed every aspect of Greek belief about leadership, national boundaries, effective government, the role of the governed, and the legitimacy of power.

His depiction of the trial and death of Socrates is one of the classics of western literature, and his views on ethics and politics continue to occupy a central place in our discussions 2400 years after they were written. It is, in fact, quite difficult to get through any course of study in the liberal arts without some familiarity with Plato. Nevertheless, comparatively few people realize that the views we commonly think of as ""Platonic"" represent only one strand in Plato's thought. For example, we commonly attribute to Plato a theory of the Forms on the basis of his claims in the so-called ""middle dialogues"" (mainly Republic, Phaedo, and Symposium). However, in his philosophically more sophisticated and notoriously difficult later dialogues (such as the Parmenides, Philebus, Sophist and Statesman), Plato engages in radical criticism and revision of his earlier views. In this course, we will spend the first third of the semester attempting to understand the metaphysics and epistemology in Plato's middle dialogues. We will spend the balance of the semester coming to grips with Plato's arguments in the later dialogues. We will read several complete dialogues in translation, and will also read a wide variety of secondary source material.

This course examines the history and material culture of Roman cities in the Near East, from Pompey's annexation of Syria in 64 BCE to the Arab conquest in the 7th century CE.

Octavian's victory at battle of Actium in 31 BCE officially brought an end to the Roman civil wars, but it did not in itself unify the empire. Out of this matrix of social fragmentation and uncertainty arose the geographical texts of the Augustan age. The genre of universal geography provided a convenient means to reconfigure identity boundaries in post-Actium world. By delineating stable borders between the peoples and provinces, geographical texts (whether written, sculptural or pictorial) literally mapped out identity boundaries and power relationships to create a new, unified image of the Roman Empire. This course examines the political and cosmological of implications geographical sources produced under the Roman Empire, including the <I>Res Gestae</I> of Augustus, Strabo's <I>Geography</I> and Tacitus' <I>Germania</I>.

How did the evaporation of imperial political and military structures change the cultural and religious fabric of Europe? And above all, what is it that divides the ancient from the medieval world? Few questions in European history have occupied historians as insistently as these, and yet for all the lengthy books, ponderous documentaries, and political polemics, we are no closer to a consensus view. This tutorial will approach these timeless questions, first, through a comparative survey of the post-Roman Mediterranean, considering North Africa, Spain, Italy, Gaul, and the Byzantine East in turn. We will consult key primary sources for each region, including tax records, laws, narrative histories, letters, religious texts and archeological finds, as they are variously available. This first-hand experience with the problems of post-Roman history will prepare us to engage with secondary scholarship on the late imperial and early medieval worlds. Alongside the classic catastrophist readings of post-Roman history, which see the centuries after 476 CE as a period of severe economic and social dislocation, we will explore more recent arguments that seek to circumvent the problem of Rome's fall by positing an era of economic, cultural and intellectual continuity from the fifth through the eighth centuries.",tutorial,"six essays (5-7 pages each) and six critiques, together with a longer, final essay (ca. 10 pages)",none,10,10,History majors,,,may not be taken on a pass/fail basis; not available for the Gaudino option,,,Division 2,,,Writing Intensive,HIST Group C Electives - Europe and Russia,HIST Group G Electives - Premodern,,,,,,,,,T1,TUT,TBA,,,,,,,,,,,,Knibbs,Eric,,,,,,,,,,,CLAS, 485,1151

We will first read selections from the lyric poets (e.g. Archilochus and Sappho, Tyrtaeus and Solon), whose concise and expressive poems reflected contemporary culture in a way that the archaic epics did not. Their poems create for modern readers, as they did for the Greeks, a powerful sense of the poet's personal presence and engagement with his (or her) audience. A similar intimacy characterizes the writings of many of the pre-Socratics, from which we will next read selections. Confident in the ability of the human mind to understand both the human and the physical world, the pre-Socratics anticipated what came to be known as philosophy and natural science. We will then turn to other writers who spoke directly about the political upheavals of the archaic age, focussing on the tyrant narratives of Herodotus.

The power of song to alter the mental and physical states of the audience and the world at large is intertwined with the wide variety of uses to which ancient magic was applied. Similarly, the idea of divine or supernatural inspiration can be interpreted as a reflexive enchantment that binds the poet to the transformative power of language. This tutorial course will explore the fundamental ways in which ancient Greek and Roman poetry, and its later offspring, are configured and understood as a kind of enchantment or incantation. By examining works that explicitly depict acts of enchantment as well as those that represent themselves as spells, dreams, charms, and curses, we will attempt to understand the structural and semantic relationships between song and magic across several genres. We will also consider the role of inspiration, enthusiasm, memory, truth, and falsehood in shaping both the poems themselves and discourses about poetry. Finally, we will investigate the reception and elaboration of these concepts in later European poetic traditions from the middle ages through modernity.

The ""second founding"" of the Republic by Augustus, and the careers of his successors, in turn gave later Roman writers like Tacitus fresh inspiration for Roman self-imagining and self-analysis. 
We will begin the semester in mythical Rome, reading selections from Book 1 of Livy's history which present figures like Aeneas, the Trojan refugee whose arrival in Italy was conceptually crucial to Rome's development and position in Italy and the Mediterranean; Romulus, by whom Rome was founded in an act of fratricide; the Sabine women, whose nobility prevented a deadly war between their fathers and their Roman kidnappers; and Lucretia, whose virtue and self-sacrifice led to the liberation of Rome from a decadent and violent monarchy and to the founding of the Roman Republic. We will examine how Livy deploys the storyteller's art to excite his readers' pathos, indignation, and sympathy; we will examine as well how Livy often filters his account of mythical Rome through the lens of his own time, thereby constructing Rome's past through the Augustan present.
Writing more than a century after Livy, Tacitus offers a different view of Augustus, and his account of the rude and dissolute Tiberius, the unscrupulous Livia, Rome's craven and dispirited senators, and the many scandals attached to the imperial family, figures a Rome once again suffering under a decadent monarchy. Tacitus's compressed, fastidious, inimitable prose is the vehicle for his stern yet often sardonic psychological insights, which subtly manage to combine moral judgment with prurient pleasure in the scandals of others.",discussion,"evaluation will be based on class preparation and participation, an 8- to 10-page paper, a midterm, and a final exam",CLLA 302 or permission of instructor,12,6,,,,,,,Division 1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01,SEM,MR,02:35,03:50,Hopkins Hall 105,,,,,,,,,Christensen,Kerry,,,,,,,,,,,CLLA, 405,1151

In addition to attending to the specific empirical details of this latter work, we will also discuss how current research elaborates, expands, and sharpens early conceptions of the domain and methodology of cognitive science.

This discourse of ""The Trojan War"" attained a remarkable coherence yet also thrived on substantial variations and changes over the 300-400 years of Greek literature we will explore, a dynamic of change and continuity that has persisted through the more than two millenia of subsequent Greek, Roman, Western, and non-Western participation in this discourse.

Related topics for our consideration will include Roman constructions of gender, the location and expression of virtue in the public and private spheres, the connections and conflicts between moral probity and political success, the exercise of individual power versus action on behalf of the commonwealth, the absorption of foreign customs and peoples into Rome, the management of literal and imaginary frontiers, and other anxieties of empire.

An Irishman channels the ghost of a kidnapped Renaissance geographer from Africa; a Bangladeshi woman dreams the arrival of a Pterodactyl in modern-day India; amateur Algerian actors star in one of the century's most well regarded films depicting the fall of French colonialism--our works will take us around the world, and stretch us across multiple histories of colonialism and its aftermaths.

This course offers overviews and discussions of the origin and purpose of the writings, their influence throughout history, and the development of methods of readings of the texts. We start with the origin of the writings before they became collected into the New Testament, and ask: what forms of writings (genres) in Greco-Roman culture were available to the authors of the new scriptures, and how they were used for the purpose of shaping faith in Jesus Christ and creating communities? Why just these scriptures were included, and not others, for instance, the Gospel of Thomas, is another much discussed question. The impact of the New Testament writings upon society is a problematic history; for instance, they have been used to support negative attitudes to Jews, women and homosexuals. This raises the issue of how to read the New Testament. There are many different ways of reading the New Testament; perhaps the most common way to read it is as Scripture, important for one's religious faith. In this course, however, we will focus on scholarly and academic readings of the New Testament. But they, too, have gone through many changes, influenced by contemporary methods, e.g. historical-critical ones in the 19th and into 20th century, more recently, by literary, feminist and post-colonial readings.

The story of the most revered figure in the Jewish tradition, who nevertheless remains an outsider to the very end, has fascinated commentators and inspired countless artistic and literary interpretations.

Some feel threatened, while others are intrigued, but responses to these world regions are seldom neutral. Often seen as exotic and erotic, or as a danger to the way of life of Americans and Europeans, Islam, Arabs and Latin Americans are at the forefront of socio-political debates in the United States and Europe. The origins of this world-view are historical, but are also heavily influenced by contemporary immigration and international affairs. After characterizing Islam as the greatest contemporary threat to ""Western"" civilization in his infamous essay titled ""The Clash of Civilizations,"" Samuel Huntington subsequently found it necessary to focus on Latinos as the most significant threat to American civilization. By examining literature and film from the Middle East and Latin America, and from these immigrant communities in the United States and Europe, we will go beyond superficial images and inflammatory rhetoric to explore the cultures behind the passions. Among other things, the texts of this course examine the ties between the Arab world and Latin America, and between these two regions and their neighbors to the north.

This course will read between the recipe lines, exploring cookbooks as important documents that reveal a surprising amount about history and society. As Arjun Appadurai has noted, cookbooks ""tell unusual cultural tales, combining the sturdy pragmatic virtues of all manuals with the vicarious pleasures of the literature of the senses.""
We will begin by examining the cookbooks of antiquity for what they can tell us about social status, global trade, and the distribution of foodstuffs and wealth. Moving into the medieval period we will look at cookbooks-cum-medical texts and consider the importance of diet and nutritional advice. Many early modern cookbooks were also agricultural and household primers, so we will touch on garden and table design and also discuss how the recipes reflect the great shifts of the Columbian exchange. 
The ""receipt"" books kept by many women were often their sole means of expression; these manuscripts will lead to discussions of gender and class. As we progress to the 19th century, we'll look at cookbooks intended to assimilate immigrant groups, as well as the cookbooks those groups published to keep their culinary traditions intact. We will see how nutrition becomes ever more prescriptive, as do ""domestic science"" and ""home economics"" as ways of validating women's kitchen labors. The 20th century brings a proliferation of culinary instruction in new forms, including artists' books, TV shows and videos. 
Because cookbooks engage with issues still pertinent today--gender, race, immigration, global trade, national identity, health, and religious and cultural tensions--we will approach the books through many different disciplines, from culinary history to sociology and anthropology, to the visual arts, gender studies and nutrition. Students will actively use the rich collection of rare cookbooks in Chapin Library.

This term has been used to describe works from Andy Warhol's paintings of Campbell's soup cans and Jean Baudrillard's critical essays on Disneyland to Thomas Pynchon's paranoid novel about postal conspiracy, <I>The Crying of Lot 49</I>. Theorists of the postmodern have argued that it represents not only a radical change in aesthetic sensibilities, but a fundamentally new relationship between art, language, and society. In this tutorial, we will read some of the most important theoretical essays defining the postmodern (essays which themselves often embrace this playful and sometimes ironic style), and we will pair them with artistic texts that are said to illustrate the features of postmodernism. The latter will be mainly novels and short stories from various countries, but one feature of this theory is a flattening of the distinction between high and low culture as well as between the written and the visual, so we will also examine examples from architecture, visual art, and/or broader pop culture. Along the way will ask whether global theoretical paradigms like postmodernism can help us understand other cultures better (by locating them within a single universal system), or whether this approach conceals important cultural differences. Texts will include essays by Jean Baudrillard, Fredric Jameson, Jean-François Lyotard, and others; novels and short stories by writers like Don DeLillo, Jorge Luis Borges, Italo Calvino, and Murakami Haruki; painting and sculpture associated with Pop Art and Superflat; the architecture of Williamstown area museums; etc. Writing assignments will focus on reading the theoretical texts critically and applying their ideas to the artistic texts in creative and interesting ways. Open to sophomores as well as advanced students.

The western tradition of favoring our intellectual and spiritual experience over the physical has long informed, and indeed limited, our sense of self as human beings.  While some writers maintain that the creative impulse is a gift of the muse and that it is rooted entirely in the mind or spirit, there are those for whom the human body, frequently their own, plays a central role, both in the process of creation and as a subject of artistic inquiry and contemplation. In their writing, these authors tell a very different tale with regard to the human experience, and it is focused on the primacy of the body. This course will consider the work of, among others, Maupassant, Kafka, Tanizaki, Tolstoy, Dinesen, Collodi, Babel, and Atwood in order to examine how writers from different cultural and aesthetic perspectives either present or use the body as a vehicle of expression.

Léry's fascinating account of a yearlong stay among the 'cannibals' of Brazil gets at many of the themes and debates taken up by ecocritics today: How do political, economic, religious and philosophical factors influence individual and collective conceptions of 'nature' and its value?  How do acts of reading and writing inform (or deform) our understanding of the 'natural' world?

Rather, this course will be an introduction to the different ways that literary critics have attempted to give a literary genre as loose, baggy, miscellaneous, and altogether hard-to-pin down as the novel a theoretical framework, to understand how the genre developed and how it functions. For the first couple of centuries of its existence in Britain and America, the novel was considered too popular, too commercial and unserious, and not sufficiently stylistically accomplished to merit anything like its own dedicated criticism or theory. Even now, critics can have a hard time even agreeing upon what a novel is, much less what constitutes a theory of the novel. Henry James, for example, said a novel's only duty was ""to be interesting,"" which, when you think about it, really casts a pretty broad and abstract generic net. Today, novel theory is legion. To only name a few, one can find theories of the novel that identify themselves as formalist, psychoanalytic, post-structuralist, Marxist, historical, and post-colonial, as well as accounts that emphasize sexuality and gender, for example, or the novel's trans-national development. Rather than try for an encyclopedic survey of either the novel or its theories, this course will use two or three novels as a means of testing out a range of representative works of novel theory. We will move back and forth from the theory of the novel to its practice in order to see how novel theory has developed over the past century, as well to see how the novel's own academic and popular fortunes relate to its theoretical accounts. Theorists are likely to include Henry James, Shklovsky, Benjamin, Lukacs, Barthes, Watt, McKeon, Jameson, D.A. Miller, Sedgwick, and Said. Novelists may include Austen, Dickens, George Eliot, or Henry James.",seminar,"4-5 papers; regular, substantial, and intensive participation in class","a 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam",19,19,sophomores and first-year students who have not yet taken an ENGL Gateway course,,,,,,Division 1,,,Writing Intensive,ENGL Criticism Courses,ENGL 200-level Gateway Courses,ENGL Literary Histories B,,,,,,,,01,SEM,TF,02:35,03:50,Schapiro Hall 137,,,,,,,,,Case,Alison,,,,,,,,,,,COMP, 239,1151

These categories created and reinforced difference in virtually every aspect of life, from the household to the political arena. This course examines the diverse discourses and practices around sexuality and gender in the cultures of ancient Greece and Rome, while also dismantling false assumptions about the continuity of the ""classical"" past with our own contemporary norms and values.  We will carefully analyze, contextualize, and compare a variety of texts, including selections from tragedy and comedy (Euripides, Terence), epic (Homer, Ovid) and lyric poetry (Sappho, Catullus), novels, epitaphs, and early saints' lives, in order to gain a deeper and more complex understanding of how gender and sexuality were expressed, experienced, and regulated in Greece and Rome.  Our emphasis will be on ancient texts, but selections from contemporary criticism and theory will enrich the methodological framework through which we approach those primary sources.  The course fulfills the EDI requirement by providing sufficient context for students to make independent investigations of how literary and religious texts and practices engaged with political and social institutions to maintain different life courses and different systems of reckoning for the value of men's lives, women's lives, and the lives of individuals who didn't fit easily into either category.

What is the difference between a tourist, an expat, and an émigré? What are the profound, and often comic, gaps between the traveler's expectations and the reality of living in, say, Paris or a rural village in Spain?

How do other social identifications, such as race, ethnicity, class, and gender, shape these experiences of sexuality?

Through a close reading of ancient noncanonical sources such as the Book of Enoch, Jubilees, and the Life of Adam and Eve, as well as Jewish traditions represented in Josephus, Philo, and Rabbinic literature and other accounts presented in early Christian and Gnostic texts, we will investigate the ways in which the elliptical style of Genesis generated a massive body of ancient folklore, creative exegesis, and explicit literary re-imagining of the early history of humankind. We will then turn to several continuations of these variant traditions in medieval and early modern literature, with particular attention to the extensive material on the figures of Cain and Noah. <I>All readings are in translation.</I>",discussion,evaluation will be based on class participation and several writing assignments,none,19,19,students who have already taken a course in Biblical literature,,meets Division 2 requirement if registration is under REL or JWST; meets Division 1 requirement if registration is under COMP or CLAS,core course for COMP,,,Division 2,,,,ARAB Arabic Studies Electives,JWST Core Electives,REL Jewish Tradition Courses,,,,,,,,01,LEC,TR,09:55,11:10,Greylock Makepeace,,,,,,,,,Dekel,Edan,,,,,,,,,,,COMP, 250,1151

The voice of the youth and ""the street,"" in particular, emerged as massive sources and sites for political mobilization. But, are these categories identical? Does youth culture equal popular culture? This survey course is designed to provide students with an introduction to the different layers that constitute popular culture in the Arab world since the decolonization of Arab states in the 1950s. Questions that we will ask include: What constitutes ""popular culture"" in the Arab world? How is it different than folk culture, mass culture, or ""high"" culture? Who are the key players in the creation and dissemination of ""popular"" culture? Besides globalization, for example, what other social, political and economic dynamics engulf the definition of the ""popular""? What are modes of self-fashioning and representation of Arab identity that characterize this culture? To answer these questions we will watch several documentaries about music, politics and youth in the Arab world.

The course begins with tales of doomed lovers that were popular in the eighteenth-century kabuki and puppet theaters, and that still feature prominently in Japanese popular culture, from comics to TV dramas. From there we move on to novels and films that examine a range of other relationships between love and death, including parental love and sacrifice, martyrdom and love of country, sex and the occult, and romance at an advanced age.

In the second part of the course, we will contextualize Chekhov in his own milieu, looking at how his literary works address the most discussed social and philosophical questions of his time.  We will conclude the course with three of Chekhov's mature plays--<I>Seagull, Uncle Vanya,</I> and <I>The Cherry Orchard</I>--analyzing how the plays recycle the situations, characters, and language of Chekhov's earlier stories and assessing Chekhov's debt to and influence on the Russian theater of his time, especially his complex relationship with Stanislavsky.

Representing a wide variety of geographies, literary styles and ideological perspectives, these writers nevertheless converge in challenging us to consider the effects of environmental crisis within structures of power that are radically unequal at the local, national, and global levels; and to recognize that consciousness of environmental vulnerability can prompt new forms of inclusion and community as well as exclusion. Topics to be explored also include the role of indigenous cosmologies in contemporary environmental politics, the place of urban ecologies within the environmental imaginary, and the ongoing debates among academic critics and others regarding the scope and methodologies of ecocriticism as an approach to Latin American literature.

He first received the covenant and the promise of the land of Israel, but before the full revelation of the Torah to Moses. He fathers both the Jewish people and the Arabs and the significance of that wider identity was later captured both by Christianity in the work of Paul and in the Qur'an where Muhammad identified with Abraham as the prototypical and non-sectarian monotheist prophet. This course will trace the figure of Abraham by a close and multidisciplinary reading of the Jewish, Pagan, Christian and Muslim sources on Abraham. Our task is not to decide on the historicity of Abraham, but rather to explore the history of the figure and his continuing relevance for today in understanding Jewish/Christian/Muslim conflict and cooperation. We will begin with an intensive reading of the Genesis material on Abraham (12-25), where the issues of idolatry and monotheism, the covenant and circumcision, relations of the patriarch to his women and sons, and primal model of faith all are articulated. We will then turn to later Jewish developments in the figure of Abraham in midrash and apocalypse. We will then explore the view of Abraham in the classical world, the uses made of Abraham by Christianity as it broke from an emerging Rabbinic Judaism and the development of Abraham's specific connection with the view of the afterlife. We will then treat the figure of Abraham in the Qur'an and later Islamic traditions. We will conclude with an examination of the cult surrounding Abraham in the city of Hebron, a currently contested site on the West Bank where we will consider the current religious practice regarding Abraham by both Jews and Muslims.

What's the secret?  Who is lying?  Who is quietly disregarding the rules?  The revelation of hidden knowledge--what Aristotle called anagnorisis--lies at the base of what drama is, and how theatre functions. Theatre is lying as much as lying is theatre.  So it should not be a surprise that playwrights often deliver plots and characters that pit playing against truth, and that oppose concealment and revelation as keys to dramatic action. But it should also not surprise that in the modern era, clarity in the dialectic of  ""truth and falsehood"" has eroded as well.  Relativity of honesty, contingency with regard to certain knowledge, ""truthiness""--these too have a place in the modern theatre.  This tutorial course will examine what lies hidden in American plays from the late nineteenth century to the early twenty-first.

So spoke young Werther in Johann Wolfgang Goethe's groundbreaking novel from 1774. The <I>Sorrows of Young Werther</I> exploded into high Enlightenment Germany, with its emphasis on rationality, on universal human values and on optimism about the future, a bestseller that instead exposed the volatile inner world of an extraordinary individual. Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Germany and Austria, profound interiority surfaced frequently to challenge--and even threaten--what was touted as the triumph of objective, scientific thought. At the same time, the writers and thinkers who explored the deepest recesses of the mind were beset by alienation and despair as they were drawn into inevitable conflict with dominant paradigms.
This course will examine literature and thought at the moments when the tectonic plates of reason and supposed unreason converge and collide most forcefully: around 1800 (Goethe, Kleist, and the Romantics), around 1900 (Nietzsche, Freud, Kafka, Hofmannsthal), the mid-twentieth century with its disastrous consequences (Hitler, Böll, Bachmann) and the end of the millennium (Roth, Jelinek).

This course examines the Japanese literature of three major periods in Japan's history, focusing on how literary and performance traditions have been interrelated in the unfolding of Japanese literary history. We will begin by looking into the Heian period (794-1185), when the work of female authors occupied center stage and some of the canonical texts of the Japanese literary and cultural tradition were born. Next we will consider the medieval period (1185-1600), which saw the rise of the samurai class and the consequent shift in the domain of artistic creation. Then we will look at the Edo period (1600-1867), when a new bourgeois culture flourished and audiences were greatly transformed.

From works of art to ephemeral trash, they have been public and private, sacred and profane, magical and commonplace. Likewise, notions of the book have influenced every subsequent form of communication and transmission, whether we are browsing film and song ""libraries"" or ""scrolling"" down ""pages"" on the web. This course will explore aspects of the material, social, cultural, and intellectual history of the book, from the invention of the earliest writing systems through the modern development of digital media.

This course takes time to enjoy the special pleasures of novels of epic scope: the opportunity to immerse oneself in a wide and teeming fictional world; to focus sustained attention on the changeable fortunes of characters and societies over a long span of time; to appreciate the detailed grounding of lives in their social environment and historical moment; to experience the leisurely and urgent rhythms, with their elaborate patterning of build-ups and climaxes, that are possible in such works. We will read but two novels, both preoccupied with the disruption and evolution of lives and loves at moments of historic upheaval:<I> War and Peace</I> (1869), Leo Tolstoy's epic of the Napoleonic Wars, and <I>Parade's End</I> (1924-28), Ford Madox Ford's modernist masterpiece about World War I and its traumatic impact on English social life. Set a century apart, the novels are distinguished by vivid and scrupulous representation of their respective wars, by their shrewd accounts of political and social pressures informing the crises, and by their insight into the struggles of those whose lives are engulfed in global crisis. Tolstoy's and Ford's approaches to fictional representation, however, provide intriguing contrasts: one favors the lucidity of classic realism, the other the challenges of modernist innovation; one deploys a single multiplot novel, the other a tetralogy of shorter novels developing a single plot. We will discuss the differing strategies and effects of these two approaches, as well as the more general difficulties of reading and interpreting long fiction.

At the time of the French Revolution and amid the general fervor for democratic self-rule that it represented, a handful of German philosophers asked themselves a simple and yet profound question: If modern individuals could free themselves from dogmatic belief and from the political and cultural institutions that such belief supported, what new aesthetic, social, and political forms could express and support this freedom, and how might these new forms be discovered and maintained? The famously untranslatable concept of <I>Bildung</I>, whose meaning spans notions of education, cultivation, self-discovery, and self-actualization, was a response to this question that would inform joint projects of scientific discovery, artistic self-expression, and political self-determination well beyond the borders of Germany, and to the present day. Through careful analysis of key texts from this tradition, students will explore how representations of <I>Bildung</I> reflect changing ideas about identity, agency, pleasure, knowledge, and power.

Such an audacious project of collection has rarely been attempted either before or since.  At its height, the Great Library was reputed to house over 700,000 books from across the Greek world, as well as many translations of texts originally written in Latin, Hebrew, Egyptian, and even Sanskrit.  Attracted by the vast stores of knowledge, scholars, artists, and poets flocked to the Great Library to create one of the most vibrant intellectual communities the world has ever known.  In this course, we will examine the development and influence of the Great Library and its sister institution, the Mouseion (or ""Museum"") from a variety of cultural and historical perspectives.  We will begin by exploring the political motives of the Ptolemaic kings and their reception of earlier traditions of collecting in the Greek and Near Eastern worlds.  We will then turn to the intellectual and artistic activity at the Library itself, with special attention to the development of notions of connoisseurship and canon across various disciplines.  Although implicated in the Ptolemies' political agenda, the scholars living and working in the Great Library were granted extraordinary freedom to pursue new ideas that transformed literature, science, and the arts forever.  Readings will include selections from Theocritus' <I>Idylls</I>, Apollonius' <I>Argonautica</I> and Eratothenes' <I>Geography</I>.  Finally, we will examine the legacy of the Great Library from the Roman empire to the present day, focusing particularly on how the concept of a universal archive has shaped the collecting practices of everything from modern art museums and Google Books to such governmental entities as the NSA.  <I>All readings are in translation</I>.",lecture,"evaluation will be based on classroom performance, three response papers, one 12- to 15-page paper, and a midterm exam",none,30,20,"preference given to majors or prospective majors in Classics, History, and Comparative Literature",meets Division 1 requirement if registration is under CLAS or COMP; meets Division 2 requirement if registration is under HIST,,,,,Division 1,,,,HIST Group C Electives - Europe and Russia,HIST Group G Electives - Premodern,,,,,,,,,01,LEC,TF,01:10,02:25,,,,,,,,,,Rubin,Benjamin,,,,,,,,,,,COMP, 293,1153

It is not enough for it merely to be <I>about</I> a character who happens to be a philosopher; nor is it just that philosophical positions are reviewed in the narrative, as in Gaarder's <I>Sophie's World</I>. Milan Kundera tried to answer this question by saying that a good philosophical novel does not serve philosophy but, on the contrary, tries to ""get hold of a domain that (...) philosophy had kept for itself. There are metaphysical problems, problems of human existence, that philosophy has never known how to grasp in all their concreteness and that only the novel can seize."" If Kundera is right, fictional narratives (such as novels) sometimes do the philosophical work that philosophy cannot do for itself. What kind of work is that, and how is it accomplished? Why can't argumentative prose--philosophers' preferred form of expression--clearly <I>say</I>, and moreover <I>prove</I>, what literature, theatre and film illustrate, show and display? One possible answer which we will examine is that, while many philosophers recognize that there are intimate connections between what we believe, feel and do, philosophical argumentation by its very nature appeals to belief alone; narrative art, by contrast, can simultaneously engage our reason, emotions, imagination and will, thus resulting not only in deepening our understanding, but also in transformation of the self. <BR>
To properly address a number of interrelated questions concerning philosophy <I>in</I> literature and film, and philosophical problems <I>of</I> meaning, interpretation and evaluation of narrative fiction, we will discuss both narrative works of art and theoretical approaches to their analysis. We will consider the ways in which narrative fiction presents and engages its audience in philosophical reflections on personal identity, nature of the self, interpersonal relationships, memory, time, human existence, freedom, and the meaning in life. 
The works to be discussed and analyzed in the tutorial meetings will be by some of the following writers and directors: Kafka, Dostoyevsky, Sartre, de Beauvoir, Camus, Thomas Mann, Borges, Kundera, Ecco, Bergman, Tarkovsky, Resnais, Kurosawa, Bunuel and Kubrick.

Does the term ""diaspora"" necessarily invoke the specter of racial essentialism? What happens to concepts of of race, racialization and racism when one moves away from local and national politics? Is the idea of a diasporic subject much less vexing than the idea of a racially minoritized person? How important a role does the shared English language play in these diasporas?

But in Verne's vision of modernity, technological sophistication gives way to intellectual stagnation and social indifference, in a world where poetry and literature have been abandoned in favor bureaucratic efficiency, mechanized surveillance, and the merciless pursuit of profit. To contest or confirm this dystopic vision, we will examine a broad range of twentieth-century novels and their focus on adversity, dignity, and modernity. In a century dominated by the devastation of two World Wars, the atrocities of colonial empire, and massive social and political transformation, the novel both documented and interrogated France's engagement with race and ethnicity, gender and sexuality, colonialism and immigration. Within this historical context, we will discuss the role of the novel in confronting war and disease, challenging poverty and greed, and exposing urban isolation and cultural alienation in twentieth-century France.

The power of song to alter the mental and physical states of the audience and the world at large is intertwined with the wide variety of uses to which ancient magic was applied. Similarly, the idea of divine or supernatural inspiration can be interpreted as a reflexive enchantment that binds the poet to the transformative power of language. This tutorial course will explore the fundamental ways in which ancient Greek and Roman poetry, and its later offspring, are configured and understood as a kind of enchantment or incantation. By examining works that explicitly depict acts of enchantment as well as those that represent themselves as spells, dreams, charms, and curses, we will attempt to understand the structural and semantic relationships between song and magic across several genres. We will also consider the role of inspiration, enthusiasm, memory, truth, and falsehood in shaping both the poems themselves and discourses about poetry. Finally, we will investigate the reception and elaboration of these concepts in later European poetic traditions from the middle ages through modernity.

It is often said that everything is a text and that all knowledge is power. But just as the typewriter has given way to the computer and disco to dubsteb, as we exit postmodernity new philosophies are appearing on the conceptual horizon.
This course will layout this challenge to postmodernism by exploring the work of cutting edge theorists in French and American movements known as new materialism, speculative realism, and actor-network theory. Often drawing on work in ecology, feminism, science studies, neuroscience and complexity theory, these thinkers aim to reclaim knowledge of the real world, to suture the separation between the sciences and the humanities, and to overturn what they see as the dualism between matter (as dead or inert) and mind (as the locus of life and agency). By so doing, they claim to empower the object-world and dethrone humanity from the center of philosophy. Thinkers to be considered may include: Karen Barad, Jane Bennett, Bruno Latour, Catherine Malabou, Quentin Meillassoux and Bernard Stiegler.

In addition to exploring the shared guilt of all four of the brothers Karamazov in the crime of patricide, Dostoevsky poses the most probing questions of his day:  Are families tied together merely by blood or by deeper spiritual bonds? Is religious faith possible in an age of reason, science, and technology? Can man's earthly laws ever carry out divine justice?

1,Comparative Literature,COMP,019964,2,Fall 2014,,COMP, 332,Hiphop and The Changing Same: African American Consciousness And Music 1925--2015,,,,AFR 332/COMP 332,Secondary,"In Amiri Baraka's book Black Music and especially in its pivotal 1967 essay  'The Changing Same--R&B And The New Music'' he examines the musical and political complementarity of the most experimental jazz of the 60s and the most socially conscious  rhythm and blues  of the day. Baraka proposed  a populist modernism that would unite the most commercial and the most avant-garde streams of Black Music. The goal was to forge what Baraka called a Unity Music--one that would esthetically mirror and presage an ideal unification  of  divergent African American political philosophies and protest movements. 
The notion that Black Music could play a vital role in the pursuit of social justice gained popular and vocal modernist proponents during the 1920s Harlem Renaissance via Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, The Bebop Generation of Billie Holiday, Charlie Parker, Thelonius Monk, Dizzy Gillespie and Mary Lou Williams, Miles Davis and Max Roach who followed Ellington and Armstrong  built upon their innovations and anti-racist stances. The Beboppers have been described as the ''forerunners of the Civil Rights movement'' for their stance towards discrimination and radical experimentation. The post-bop and freedom jazz musicians such as Sun Ra, John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman, who carried the baton for freedom jazz in the late 50s and 60s came to sonically represent the fire and fury of the Civil Rights and Black Power movements. Through Baraka's own creative and rhetorical interventions their music became the artistic standard bearers of the Black Arts Movement. The socially conscious R&B and Funk of the 1970s as parlayed by bands such as Earth Wind and Fire, Parliament-Funkadelic, Rufus, War and Mandrill fused  the energy of freedom jazz with the populist modernism of funk avatars James Brown,  Curtis Mayfield, Jimi Hendrix and Sly Stone. Their work greatly influenced global pop insurgents such as Bob Marley and The Wailers and Fela Kuti who wrought critical hybrids of indigenous and imported forms to speak truth to power in their homelands, and beyond.
Hiphop culture inherited the popular modernist mantle  and openly radical-activist imperative jazz had largely abandoned by the 1990s. As hiphop evolved in that decade it became a platform for new alignments of  art, commerce and politics. Novel tensions emerged between the culture's pro-capitalist instincts and its desire to represent African American working class struggle. Hiphop music in Africa simultaneously blossomed as  a vehicle for anti-oppression and anti-corruption  activism. 
The course will draw heavily upon Baraka's seminal books <I>Blues People and Black Music</I>, alongside David Levering Lewis'  <I>When Harlem Was In Vogue</I> Tricia Rose's <I>Black Noise</I> and Jeff Chang's <I>Can't Stop Wont Stop</I> to revisit and re-interrogate these  historic epochs when music, politics and the marketplace converged to transform the relationships between activism, mass-culture-industry production and the social consumption of music. Examination of  the role music has played in forwarding and complicating African American social justice movements will be the paramount focus.",lecture,two 5- to 7-page papers and a final 10- to 20-page paper/project,none,25,25,Africana concentrators,,,,,,Division 2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01,LEC,MW,11:00,12:15,Griffin 5,,,,,,,,,Tate,Gregory,,,,,,,,,,,COMP, 332,1151

One of the aims of this course is to challenge traditional notions and expectations of narrative. For instance, what could minimally constitute a narrative piece? How do different mediums allow for time to unfold in unexpected ways? How does omission play a powerful role in a narrative? How might the role of the narrator (often so powerful and present in novels and short stories) change in a visual arts context?

Although he was not explicitly preoccupied with articulating political principles and only rarely addressed questions of governance or policy, his assumptions, theories, and therapeutic techniques have fundamental implications for the basic questions of political theory--questions about, for instance, the sources of conflict and group cohesion, what ways of living are desirable and attainable, and the place of reason, desire, emotion, affect, and motive in the interpretation and explanation of human interaction. This tutorial offers an in-depth exploration of Freud's key writings and concepts, from his early work on sexuality and dreams through his final writings. While we will read some of the texts that most directly address conventional political topics, Freud generally has more to say to students of politics when he is formulating his fundamental views of the psyche (of the nature and role of the unconscious, of drives, etc.), and the syllabus will reflect that view. Over the course of the semester, we will consider some scholarly commentaries on specific texts as well as critical assessments of the psychoanalytic project; as time allows, we may also engage such key later psychoanalytical thinkers as Klein, Winnicott, Lacan, and Kristeva.

We start with Gadamer's hermeneutics, which offers a classical formulation of the philosophy of liberal arts education, stressing the importance of questioning one's prejudices. Although this approach offers important resources for understanding ourselves in a world of cultural differences, it also has limitations, which we explore through the works of Derrida, Foucault and Said. In this way, we question some of the notions central to understanding ourselves such as identity and difference, suggesting some of the difficulties in the ever more important yet problematic project of knowing oneself. We also suggest that representation is not innocent but always implicated in the world of power and its complexities, particularly within the colonial and postcolonial contexts explored by Said.

If we can imagine a kind of literature that truly goes under the headings of ""World Literature,"" or ""Global Literature,"" what can we possibly exclude? Doesn't all literature belong to the world? What might we gain by using this term, and what might we lose? What histories are attached to the various names and classifications we assign to culture and how does cultural ""othering"" uphold or resist forms of economic, political, and military dominance? In this tutorial we will work carefully through the history and influential writings of postcolonialism as a particular challenge to hegemonic forms of representation, cultural production, and naming, starting with a close consideration of the writings of the movement's founders and key commentators, including Aimé Césaire, Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, Gayatri Spivak, Robert J.C. Young, Gauri Viswanathan, and Sara Suleri, and consider their influence on later postcolonial writers and critics around the world. In the second half of the semester, we will turn our attention to the historical underpinnings and current firestorm of debates about World Literature, beginning with Goethe, Marx, Adorno, Frederic Jameson, Franco Moretti, and Pascale Casanova and shifting finally to critics of the ideas of World and Global Literature.

This course will consider two loosely affiliated artistic movements, aestheticism and decadence, as responses both scandalized and scandalizing to this exhilarating period.  Part of what's so tricky here is the elusiveness of the terms we'll be studying. So, much of our work will entail tracing out the multiple and often contradictory uses of them: do these terms designate a distinct cultural moment, an historically bounded period, a loose set of writers and artists, a theme?  Or, might we better conceptualize aestheticism and decadence as a style of writing or a style of the self, or even a mode of art that seeks to disrupt such distinctions as the one between the self and writing--one we might find in 21st-century New York as 19th-century London?  We'll read writers such as Oscar Wilde, who reveled in amoral manifestos like ""art for art's sake"" by elevating artifice and shallowness to first principles of life; but also Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, who has his own thing for artifice.  Noting the high body count in these works, we'll also ask why these texts seem so concerned with fatality, with death, with addiction, with various forms of losing the self--in art, in the metropolis, in another person. We'll focus as well on attempts to rethink traditional social bonds in works that value variously, solitude over sociality, the transient encounter over the enduring relationship, promiscuity over fidelity, and to think about how literary form might relate to those efforts.",seminar,"2 short papers, a series of shorter response papers, regular and substantial contributions to class discussions","a 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam",25,25,English majors,,,may not be taken on a pass/fail basis,,,Division 1,,,,ENGL Literary Histories B,,,,,,,,,,01,SEM,W,01:10,03:50,,,,,,,,,,McWeeny,Gage,,,,,,,,,,,COMP, 354,1153

From Rabindranath Tagore's mystical poetry to Viaks Swarup's novel that inspired <I>Slumdog Millionaire</I>, the styles and aesthetics of Indian English are as vast as the peninsula itself, and the literature that has emerged from this diverse region has utterly reshaped contemporary global culture. ""Impossible India"" will introduce students to modern South Asian literature written in English. We will aim to discover how the writing of the so-called subcontinent has effected massive literary and theoretical transformations far beyond its boundaries in literary institutions around the globe. With an attention to shifting codes of ethnicity, race, religion, and other forms of identity within India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, as well as in the African, Caribbean, and American diasporas, the course is organized around the question of what makes South Asian literature South Asian, especially when we consider the South Asian novel in English. Major topics of discussion will include caste, gender, nationalism, globalization, cosmopolitanism, crime, and hybridity. Additionally, we will take up select contemporary criticism on subaltern studies, postcolonialism, and narratology. This class will be of interest to students curious about global perspectives on race and ethnicity, postcolonialism, the contemporary novel in English, and comparative literature. Authors will include Anand, Naipaul, Narayan, Suleri, Rushdie, Roy, Lahiri, as well as select works of poetry, film, and visual art.

This unique interdisciplinary studio/seminar course examines how dance and theater channel, preserve and transmit stories and cultural memory through individual and collective bodies. Dance and theater are traditionally defined as ephemeral arts, bounded by the limits of linear time and space. Yet, as Rebecca Schneider writes, ""time is decidedly folded and fraught."" Repetition and reenactment are forms of remembering, and performance is often not what disappears but what remains.How do we pass on knowledge in visceral and affective ways? What is a ""repertoire""? What are the benefits and risks of continuity over time?
Taught as part of the Books Unbound curricular initiative, and in conjunction with the opening of the Sawyer-Stetson Library, the course will complete a project in which the class ""embodies"" material, first by exploring stories embodied by individual members of the class, and then by translating them through performance by the collective, culminating in dance/theatre pieces performed in the new library. Over the term, we will also study modern and contemporary American artists, such as: Martha Graham, The Wooster Group, Alvin Ailey, Meredith Monk, Anne Bogart, Ralph Lemon, Elevator Repair Service, Bill T.

Whether as a religious, political or amorous posture, fanaticism is universally decried and never avowed. But what is fanaticism, and why should it be considered such a threat, particularly during a period that for the most part embraced an enlightened secular rationalism? In this course, we will explore these questions by considering literary texts that dramatize fanaticism in light of accounts by such philosophers and historians as Voltaire, Kant, Rousseau, Hobbes, Hume, Burke, Carlyle, Mill, and Adorno.  Literary readings will be drawn from works by Swift, de Stael, Shelley, Hogg, Dickens, Eliot, Hawthorne, Conrad, and Sinclair, as well as films by Dreyer, Riefenstahl, Le Roy and Pontecorvo, and drawings and engravings by Hogarth and Goya. While some of these works oppose fanaticism to enlightenment values, others see it as an effect of those values, which include sympathy, self-examination, and political flexibility.

But what that might mean -- whether it points toward a lone gunman or a conspiracy, toward the Soviet Union or the CIA -- still remains uncertain.

At the other end of the spectrum, avant-garde writing is seen to concern itself ""purely"" with formal questions, divorced from the socio-historical (and certainly not sullied by the taint of race). In the critical realm we currently inhabit, in which ""race"" is opposed to the ""avant-garde,"" an experimental minority writer can indeed seem an oxymoron. In this class we will closely read recent work by Asian American, African American, Native American and Latino/a writers which challenges preconceptions about ethnic literature, avant-garde writing, genre categorization, among other things. The writing done by these mostly young, mostly urban, poets and fiction writers is some of the most exciting being written in the United States today; their texts push the boundaries of aesthetic form while simultaneously engaging questions of culture, politics, and history.

Yet silent cinema represents an era of unparalleled transformation in which structures of narrative and the language of visual representation were virtually re-invented to meet the needs and the potentialities of a new medium, and the very relationship between art and entertainment was re-defined, producing hundreds of films that are the aesthetic equal of any contemporary work. The absence of synchronous sound allowed silent cinema a visual freedom that fostered forms of artistic experimentation unattainable in sound cinema, leading some aestheticians to proclaim the artistic superiority of silent cinema.  In this course we will survey classic narrative films by such directors as D. W. Griffith, Erich von Stroheim, and Abel Gance; stars of silent cinema such as Greta Garbo, Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and Rudolph Valentino; the flowering of American silent comedy in the work of Chaplin and Keaton; the creation of exciting new modes of political art by Eisenstein, Pudovkin, Vertov, and other directors of Soviet montage cinema; expressionist, surrealist, and other avant-garde work by such filmmakers as Murnau, Dulac, Man Ray, Buñuel, and Dreyer; and brilliant silent films by major directors better known for their sound films, such Ernst Lubitsch, Yasujiro Ozu, and Alfred Hitchcock.

What are the ideas associated with these different movements, and how are they connected?

But as the great theorist of children's animation and stoner movies Jack Halberstam has noted, sometimes failure turns out to be a better bet than success: it can reveal the blindspots of dominant ideologies, while opening up alternative ways of living in the world.  This course will take a long detour through meditations on failure emerging from queer theory, Asian American studies, and black studies, with a particular interest in what failure can reveal about higher education and related disciplinary institutions, such as prisons or the so-called ""internment camps"" for Japanese Americans during World War II.  This course fulfills the Exploring Diversity requirement by considering how the stigmatization of difference and justification of social inequality are inscribed in supposedly neutral rubrics of success and failure.

The course examines three historical incarnations of ""wonder,"" each involving complex relations among the aesthetic, philosophical, and social domains: the Renaissance tradition of wonder and the marvelous; the eighteenth-century analysis of the sublime; and twentieth-century accounts of the culture of spectacle. We will consider writers such as Shakespeare, Sir Thomas Browne, Wordsworth, Borges, and W.G.

The past 25 years of queer studies, media, and activism (1990-2015) have led to unprecedented visibility and great advances for many LGBT people, especially in North America and Western Europe: from breakthroughs in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, to victories for Gays in the Military, Employment Non-Discrimination, and Gay Marriage in 16 US states and another 16 countries around the world. For many, however, this new era of queer life during the past 2 decades has eclipsed the time before, when those who were pejoratively labeled as queer struggled with homophobic discrimination, isolation, and violence, by seeking one another out in major cities, specific neighborhoods, underground bars, and in the narrative spaces of novels and films. As a result, many young people born after 1990 are largely unaware of these struggles that predate their lives, the internet, and social media; and several LGBT leaders worry that this has left many 18-25 year olds with a false sense of security, a decreasing interest in political engagement, alarming new rates of sexually transmitted infections, and a growing disinterest in queer social spaces beyond the virtual. In this course, we will explore the literary, cinematic, and cultural history of gay and lesbian lives before the 1990s, and consider what has been gained and lost. Topics to include the early twentieth-century isolation of the closet, (1890s-1950s), the formation of clandestine gay and lesbian communities during and after World War II (1940s-60s), the Stonewall riots and the first decade of Gay Liberation (1969-1979), and the devastating losses and community responses to AIDS (1979-1995).

But his intellectual interests were wide-ranging: from French literary theory to Vico to Middle East politics to Glenn Gould. A true public intellectual, Said was a rarity among university academics. Besides writing several important scholarly books, he also wrote for various non-academic publications, such as <I>The Nation, Al-Ahram</I>, and <I>The London Review of Books</I>; co-founded, with the musician Daniel Barenboim, the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra; and, from 1977-1991, served as a member of the Palestinian National Council.

What would a community founded on such a conception of justice look like? Can we imagine a version of community not founded on exclusion? What would the members of such a community look like--what version of subjectivity would that community imply?  And might literature in particular have something to say about the possibilities for such versions of community, selfhood, and justice? This course will look at recent, theoretically-oriented writing on justice and community, with an emphasis on the work of Hannah Arendt, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Luc Nancy and Giorgio Agamben. No prior knowledge of these writers is expected, but the course does require a willingness to wrestling with demanding (and rewarding) theoretical argument. We will place the philosophical work in relation to fiction from Euripides to Kafka, films (Resnais, Farhadi), photography (Silva, <I>Badlands</I>) and worldly examples of competing claims to justice. 
The course pursues the aims of the EDI initiative in part by engaging works in which cultural differences reveal the limits of universalizing accounts of law and justice, works such as Euripides' <I>Bacchae</I>, Nuruddin Farah's <I>Maps</I>, Louise Erdrich's poetry, and Farhadi's <I>A Separation</I>. But the course will equally suggest that such contingency is inherent in the concept of justice as such, insofar as the problem of justice is bound up with forms of constituting indebtedness that define humans as communal beings. In that sense, contingency and difference mark justice even in its most familiar instances--intimately and close to home, as it were.",seminar with tutorial sessions,"one 5-page paper, and a final 15-page paper",300-level English course or permission of instructor,15,15,"English majors, students who have taken Criticism/Theory course in any discipline",,,,,,Division 1,Exploring Diversity,,,ENGL Criticism Courses,JLST Interdepartmental Electives,,,,,,,,,01,SEM,TF,02:35,03:50,Stetson 501,,,,,,,,,Pye,Christopher,,,,,,,,,,,COMP, 407,1151

Building on this foundation, we will investigate the profound methodological impact of feminist and queer literary criticism.  We will examine the ways in which such scholarship has not only challenged the neglect of gender and sexuality but also generated new theoretical frameworks and approaches to interpretation. Our investigation will be guided by questions such as: What is the relationship between feminist and queer theories and other interpretive approaches such as new criticism, poststructuralism, psychoanalysis, critical race theory, new historicism, and postcolonial theory? In what ways do feminist and queer theories differ and disagree about literary studies? What constitutes a feminist reading practice or queer method of interpretation?

Students will give close attention to a single theorist or philosophical school or perhaps to a single question as taken up by several theorists. Prior coursework in critical theory or continental philosophy, no matter the department, is strongly recommended. The subject of this semester's seminar is Jacques Derrida. We often think of language as best when it is living and intimate: words spoken to a lover, arguments shared around a seminar table, the poet we finally get to hear read her works out loud. But it is Derrida's signature argument that language is never really intimate in these ways -- that it is always adrift, separated at once from the person who speaks or writes it, from the person to whom it is addressed, and from the things in the world that it putatively names. The words you speak and write aren't really yours; nor can you ever be sure they will carry the meanings you intend them to have; nor can you guarantee that they will reach the people for whom they were devised, or that they will reach only them. Derrida's core claim is that this is nothing to worry about -- that, on the contrary, a liberated philosophy will have to keep faith with a language thus unfixed. We will spend the semester considering this idea and reckoning its consequences for our understandings of literature, metaphysics, ethics, politics, and law.",seminar,seminar paper of 25 pages; informal weekly writing; class attendance and participation,"a 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam; prior coursework in critical theory or continental philosophy, no matter the department, is strongly recommended",15,15,seniors with background in critical theory,,,may not be taken on a pass/fail basis,,,Division 1,,,,ENGL Criticism Courses,,,,,,,,,,01,SEM,TF,02:35,03:50,,,,,,,,,,Thorne,Christian,,,,,,,,,,,COMP, 456,1153

Thus, the work is judged primarily in terms of its embodied sociological content (material, empirical) and not by ""abstract"" standards of aesthetic subtlety, philosophical sophistication, and so on. At the same time, in the popular and academic imaginary, minority subjects and artists poets occupy a single abstract signifying category--homogeneous, undifferentiated, ""other,"" marginalized, non-universal--while racially ""unmarked"" (white) artists occupy the position of being universal and individual at once. 
The irony, of course, is that, say, an African American poet's being read as an abstract signifier does not mean that the black subject or writer is seen as capable of engaging in abstract ideas. This course will ask questions about the problem of race and abstraction by looking at the work of various African American and Asian American writers, visual artists and musicians--including Will Alexander, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, David Hammons, Yayoi Kusama, Tan Lin, Nathaniel Mackey, and Cecil Taylor--as well as critics.

The course proposes that developing these skills has the potential to ignite, inform and/or complicate one's creative practice, social perspectives, and citizenship. The class provides students with highly specific exercises for building strength, flexibility, endurance, and physical range, while also prioritizing improvisational techniques for moving and vocalizing on our own, with partners, and as a group. Combining these approaches allows us to examine how the attention, freedom, play, and curiosity of improvisation can illuminate set exercises, and how the specifications and limits of set work might inform and clarify our more open-ended practice. <I>Skills</I> draws from a variety of approaches including Yoga, Body Weather Laboratory, Contact Improvisation, Jazz Dance, Authentic Movement, Mindfulness Meditation, and the work of La Pocha Nostra, Deborah Hay, and d.

In the 1960s the Judson Dance Theater and other dance makers often took cues from their colleagues in visual art and music. Today there is a renewed interest in the body and performance in gallery and museum contexts while at the same time the contemporary dance world is re-visiting interdisciplinary sensibilities and techniques, newly challenging how ""dance"" can be defined. Stillness and quotidian action are again being framed as choreography, dancers are using technology and materials to create visual and sonic products from their movements, obsessively repetitive actions and physical exhaustion and endurance, trends long popular in live art/performance, are being re-contextualized by choreographers and/or in traditional theatrical settings, dance and dancers are regularly performing outside of traditional theaters, and projects featuring humans moving in collaboration with urban and natural environments are commonplace.
Dismissing the need to determine weather or not a given performance is in fact dance, this course proposes the reclamation of the word choreography to include any movement (or stillness) of bodies in space and time. Expanding definitions of choreography, the class calls on compositional techniques from dance as well as strategies not traditionally considered for application to choreography. Through in-class experiential exercises, readings, video and performance viewing (of contemporary and historical work by well-known and lesser-known artists), discussion, and individual performance-making, the class will employ several interdisciplinary ways of inventing and organizing movement, a handful of approaches to how a maker transmits ideas to a performer, and a variety of examples of how and for what purpose an artist frames these particular actions and inactions in a given context. We will look at a number of works categorized within the field of dance, while also considering examples from live/performance art, conceptual practice, music/sound, installation and sculpture. Students will make several performances, working on their own as solo performers, as directors of group projects, and as a collaborative team of makers.",studio,"class participation, regular written and choreographic assignments, and final research/performance project","expierence in dance, theater, performance, video or literary arts",10,10,juniors and seniors; if over enrolled instructor may ask for statement of interest,,,,,,Division 1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,STU,,,,,,,,,,,,,van der Kolk,Hana,,,,,,,,,,,DANC, 302,1141

This unique interdisciplinary studio/seminar course examines how dance and theater channel, preserve and transmit stories and cultural memory through individual and collective bodies. Dance and theater are traditionally defined as ephemeral arts, bounded by the limits of linear time and space. Yet, as Rebecca Schneider writes, ""time is decidedly folded and fraught."" Repetition and reenactment are forms of remembering, and performance is often not what disappears but what remains.How do we pass on knowledge in visceral and affective ways? What is a ""repertoire""? What are the benefits and risks of continuity over time?
Taught as part of the Books Unbound curricular initiative, and in conjunction with the opening of the Sawyer-Stetson Library, the course will complete a project in which the class ""embodies"" material, first by exploring stories embodied by individual members of the class, and then by translating them through performance by the collective, culminating in dance/theatre pieces performed in the new library. Over the term, we will also study modern and contemporary American artists, such as: Martha Graham, The Wooster Group, Alvin Ailey, Meredith Monk, Anne Bogart, Ralph Lemon, Elevator Repair Service, Bill T.

For example, how did musician Sidney Bechet's migration from New Orleans to Chicago to London influence the early jazz era? How did Katherine Dunham's dance performances in Germany help her shape a new black dance aesthetic? Why did writer James Baldwin go all the way to Switzerland to write his first novel on black, religious culture in Harlem?

In fact, core economic theories predict that people and firms, left to their own devices, will often tend to pollute too much, conserve too little, overfish common waters, and cut down too many trees. These predictions seem to be borne out by the world's environmental problems. Fortunately, economics offers tools to address these issues, and these tools are increasingly gaining attention in the policy world. In this course, we will survey environmental and natural resource economics, fields that work to inform policy with attention to both natural assets and human needs. We will focus on real-world problems, mostly from a microeconomic perspective. Underlying issues in these fields include: why markets might be inefficient where the environment and natural resources are concerned; whether and how to value the benefits we receive from the environment; and how to carefully evaluate policies. We will study the economists' perspective on sustainability and we'll discuss how sustainability, growth, and human wellbeing relate to each other. We will study the use of non-renewable resources (like oil) and renewable resources (like trees and fish), and we will spend some time talking about energy and energy policy. We will examine issues related to pollution, looking at traditional ""command and control"" regulations and at market-based pollution control policies.

Just two years ago the International Monetary Fund published the most optimistic growth projections for Africa in decades, predicting rapid growth driven by higher commodity prices, stronger agricultural output and the dividends of years of difficult economic reforms. Today, economic analysts are downgrading African growth forecasts in the face of growing poverty and macroeconomic challenges. Food prices have more than doubled in some countries--increasing hunger for the most vulnerable groups. Fuel costs--and subsidy policies in some countries--are creating macroeconomic imbalances, and the global financial crisis is depressing demand for Africa's exports. Private capital flows, which reached record levels until 2007, are expected to decline by $300-400 billion over the next two years, with bank lending falling, portfolio investment declining, and foreign direct investment decreasing. This triple-F crisis--food, fuel and financial--is posing renewed challenges to African leaders trying to tackle the imperatives of economic development and pro-poor and inclusive economic growth. This crisis is raising the costs of reforms in countries reliant on exports and international capital for growth. Successful strategies must combine policies more efficiently than ever--to balance the necessary reforms with initiatives that offset the costs for the most vulnerable. This tutorial will analyze critical questions posed by the emerging crisis: Which countries will be hit the hardest, and how deeply and for how long? Through which channels does the contagion afflict national economies? And perhaps most importantly, what coordinated strategies can African nations develop in order to foster effective responses? This tutorial will explore how policy-makers in Africa are working to build successful inclusive growth strategies, with fiscal, monetary, industrial, trade and labor market policies reinforcing each other rather than working at cross purposes.","tutorial, will meet weekly for one hour in groups of two",evaluation will be based on five short papers and on the quality of the student's oral presentations and commentary on the work of his/her colleagues,ECON 252 (or concurrently) or permission of the instructor,10,10,,,,,,,Division 2,,,Writing Intensive,POEC Comparative POEC/Public Policy Courses,,,,,,,,,,,TUT,,,,,,,,,,,,,Samson,Michael,,,,,,,,,,,ECON, 225,1113

Does public ownership of water improve the way it is provided and used? Why do societies differ in their approaches to allocating water and are some systems better than others? What does it mean to have a property right to water? Could private property rights to water help address the water pollution problem? How can societies change their water-related property rights, regulations and social institutions when individuals have implicit or explicit rights to the institutional status quo?

In the United States and around the world the rising elderly population is putting increasing pressure on health spending. Globally, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is causing severe economic hardship, and many people lack access to basic health care. More positively, advances in health care have widened the scope of possible treatments. Given the importance of good health for individual well-being, it is not surprising that health, health care and how to pay for it are  sources of anxiety for individuals and policymakers worldwide. In this course we will analyze the economics of health by applying standard microeconomic techniques to the problems of health and health care markets.

In many developed economies, a process of regional decline is associated with older, industrial cities. In developing countries, the process of economic growth is generally associated with increasing urbanization. Urbanization, with its increasing concentration of population and production, puts particular pressure on markets to allocate resources for provision of land, housing, transportation, labor and public goods. Urbanization can alter the productivity of land, labor, and capital in ways that can improve the welfare of residents and the performance of the broader economy. In this course we will examine these conflicting economic forces and examine some recent research that contributes to our understanding of the difference between regional growth and decline, and the role that the urban structure plays in these processes.

So if you are interested in what government policy can do to promote efficiency, equity, and economic development, you should be interested in tax policy. Governments must raise tax revenue to finance critical public goods, address other market failures and distributional issues, and to avoid problems with debt and inflation. Taxes typically take up anywhere from ten to fifty percent of a country's income, they profoundly affect the incentives to undertake all varieties of economic activity, and the government expenditures that they finance have potentially large consequences for human welfare. So the stakes involved in improving tax policy are quite large. All of these issues are of great importance in developing and transitional countries (also known as ""emerging markets""), but in these nations taxation is especially challenging because of serious problems with tax evasion and administration, among other things. This class provides an in-depth exploration of tax policy, with an emphasis on the challenges and issues most relevant in emerging markets. Topics addressed in this class include: how basic economic principles can be applied to help one think about the efficiency and equity consequences of tax policies; how personal income taxes, corporate income taxes, and value-added taxes are designed and administered and how they influence the economy; ideas for fundamental reforms of these taxes; theory and evidence in the debate over progressive taxes versus ""flat"" taxes; how various elements of tax design affect incentives to save and invest; how market failures may influence the optimality of different tax policies; the implications of global capital flows and corporate tax avoidance for the design of tax policy; tax holidays and other special tax incentives for investment; empirical evidence on the influence of taxes on economic growth, foreign direct investment, labor supply, and tax evasion; case studies of efforts to reform tax administration and reduce tax evasion and corruption; taxes on land and property; presumptive taxation; the ""unofficial"" economy and its implications for tax policy; tax policy towards natural resources such as minerals and oil; taxes on imports and exports; non-tax methods of raising revenue; and political economy considerations in tax policy.",seminar,"midterm exam, problem sets, two 7- to 10-page essays","one public economics course or microeconomics course (ECON 504 or ECON 110), and one empirical methods course (POEC 253 or ECON 255, 502, or 503); students who have previously taken ECON 351 will not be enrolled",19,15-19,"CDE students, but undergraduates with the prerequisites are welcome",,,,,,Division 2,,Quantitative/Formal Reasoning,,POEC Comparative POEC/Public Policy Courses,POEC International Political Economy Courses,,,,,,,,,01,SEM,TR,09:55,11:10,,,,,,,,,,LaLumia,Sara,,,,,,,,,,,ECON, 389,1153

The first part of the course focuses on long-run economic growth. Using economic theory and evidence, we will attempt to answer some of the most important questions in all of economics: Why are some countries poor and other countries rich? What can governments do to achieve faster and environmentally sustainable rates of growth? What are the growth consequences of sustained budget deficits? Understanding the behavior of the economy in the long run is one of the key tasks of macroeconomics. But as we have seen during the recent financial crisis, the short run matters as well. In the second part of the class, we will turn our attention to economic downturns and financial crises. Using historical work on past crises and the accumulating evidence on the current one, we will study a host of short-run topics, including financial markets, the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies, consumer expectations, asset prices, employment, and productivity. Because this is an advanced class in macroeconomics, we will approach these issues as practicing economists working with the best possible models and empirical techniques.

Investment decisions--from managing a portfolio to starting a business--are also fraught with uncertainty. Some risks are environmental--both manmade problems and natural disasters; other risks include the possibility of terrorist attack and, more locally, issues of campus safety. This tutorial explores both the private market responses to risk (e.g., financial markets, insurance markets, private contracting, and precautionary investments and saving) and government policies towards risk (e.g., regulation, taxation, and the legal system). From a theoretical standpoint, the course will build on expected utility theory, diversification, options valuation, principal-agent models, contract theory, and cost-benefit analysis.

Why have some countries grown at high rates over extended periods of time, while others have experienced little or no growth? Do all economies face comparable challenges to achieving sustained economic growth? Will poor countries catch up to rich countries or are they doomed to stagnate in a poverty trap? To answer these ""big"" questions, we will explore the underlying mechanisms of economic growth. What role is played by savings and investment (i.e., the accumulation of physical capital)? What is the influence of population growth? How important are investments in human capital (i.e., education and population health)? How important are technological differences across countries? How much significance should we ascribe to differences across countries in geographical characteristics? How much should we ascribe to differences in the quality of institutions? For each question, we will explore different theoretical and empirical strategies developed by economists to answer the question, ranging from formal models to historical and anecdotal evidence to cross-country growth and development regressions.

It provides tools for understanding the effects of government policies, as well as a useful conceptual framework for analyzing normative questions such as ""what role should government play in the economy"" and ""what is a good policy?"" The course begins by considering the efficiency of market economies, and rationales for government intervention in the market, such as public goods, externalities, information-based market failures, imperfect competition, and equity. We also consider ways that human behavior might deviate from perfect rationality, and what that might imply for policy.  Along the way, we apply these concepts to various examples of policy issues, including, among other things, the environment, education, health, infrastructure, security, social insurance, and aid to the poor.   We then turn to the general question of how to make the government work better, addressing questions such as the following.  When is it better to have the government own and produce things, and when is it better to privatize? What are the incentives of politicians and government employees, and how does the design of political and budgetary institutions affect the degree to which they serve the public interest?

So if you are interested in what government policy can do to promote efficiency, equity, and economic development, you should be interested in tax policy. Governments must raise tax revenue to finance critical public goods, address other market failures and distributional issues, and to avoid problems with debt and inflation. Taxes typically take up anywhere from ten to fifty percent of a country's income, they profoundly affect the incentives to undertake all varieties of economic activity, and the government expenditures that they finance have potentially large consequences for human welfare. So the stakes involved in improving tax policy are quite large. All of these issues are of great importance in developing and transitional countries (also known as ""emerging markets""), but in these nations taxation is especially challenging because of serious problems with tax evasion and administration, among other things. This class provides an in-depth exploration of tax policy, with an emphasis on the challenges and issues most relevant in emerging markets. Topics addressed in this class include: how basic economic principles can be applied to help one think about the efficiency and equity consequences of tax policies; how personal income taxes, corporate income taxes, and value-added taxes are designed and administered and how they influence the economy; ideas for fundamental reforms of these taxes; theory and evidence in the debate over progressive taxes versus ""flat"" taxes; how various elements of tax design affect incentives to save and invest; how market failures may influence the optimality of different tax policies; the implications of global capital flows and corporate tax avoidance for the design of tax policy; tax holidays and other special tax incentives for investment; empirical evidence on the influence of taxes on economic growth, foreign direct investment, labor supply, and tax evasion; case studies of efforts to reform tax administration and reduce tax evasion and corruption; taxes on land and property; presumptive taxation; the ""unofficial"" economy and its implications for tax policy; tax policy towards natural resources such as minerals and oil; taxes on imports and exports; non-tax methods of raising revenue; and political economy considerations in tax policy.",seminar,"midterm exam, problem sets, two 7- to 10-page essays","one public economics course or microeconomics course (ECON 504 or ECON 110), and one empirical methods course (POEC 253 or ECON 255, 502, or 503); students who have previously taken ECON 351 will not be enrolled",19,15-19,"CDE students, but undergraduates with the prerequisites are welcome",,,,,,Division 2,,Quantitative/Formal Reasoning,,POEC Comparative POEC/Public Policy Courses,POEC International Political Economy Courses,,,,,,,,,01,SEM,TR,09:55,11:10,,,,,,,,,,LaLumia,Sara,,,,,,,,,,,ECON, 514,1153

Why has literature aroused such prolonged fear and suspicion? Does literature, in fact, provide access to something legitimately dangerous? Course readings will be drawn from a range of historical periods; authors may include household names such as Plato, Dante, Milton, and Woolf as well as more experimental texts, including those of Clarice Lispector, André Breton, and Alison Bechdel.

While armies and politicians were busy using the blunt tools of violence and political rabble-rousing to advance one side or another, many artists and writers challenged the simplistic oppositions that made cultures out to be at odds with one another by giving voice to complex identities and histories. An Irishman channels the ghost of a kidnapped Renaissance geographer from Africa; a Bangladeshi woman dreams the arrival of a Pterodactyl in modern-day India; amateur Algerian actors star in one of the century's most well regarded films depicting the fall of French colonialism--our works will take us around the world, and stretch us across multiple histories of colonialism and its aftermaths. We will watch narrative and documentary cinema, look at visual art, and read poetry, fiction, essays, and philosophy, and consider how these media and genres work as forms of thoughtful resistance as well as creative expression.

Conversely, can they do you any good, even transform your vision of what it means to be good? Can reading fiction, that is, shape your moral character? Or is literature really just entertainment, however sophisticated and intellectually challenging? In this course, we will explore questions like these about the ethics of fiction, questions that have inspired some practitioners of the art to make claims such as: ""Surely one of the novel's habitual aims is to articulate morality, to sharpen the reader's sense of vice and virtue"" (John Updike); ""You write in order to change the world...and if you alter, even by a millimeter, the way a person looks at reality, then you can change it"" (James Baldwin); ""...a writer [is] as an architect of the soul"" (Doris Lessing); ""Naturally you're aware that bad art can finally cripple a man"" (Saul Bellow). If you are curious about the subject of ethics, enjoy reading narrative fictions, and are interested in thinking about the connection between the two, this may be the class for you. We will read a varied selection of fiction along with a fair amount of scholarship on the links between moral philosophy and narrative forms in order to refine the critical language we have at our disposal.

We will pay special attention to the conflict between those thinkers who see culture as a realm of freedom or equality or independence or critical thought and those thinkers who see culture as a special form of bondage, a prison without walls.

And it's not just the poets.  More recently, an exhibition of artworks that employ copyrighted material, dubbed ""illegal art,"" has challenged current U.S. copyright law.  Given the ubiquity of visual, electronic, and audio sampling in contemporary art, one might wonder if anyone even bothers to come up with alibis for today's artistic thefts. This course is about artistic and intellectual influence, inspiration, borrowing, revision, appropriation, sampling and outright stealing.  Rooting our inquiry in literary texts, we'll ask a series of questions as we look at a variety of material that troubles ideas about novel and derivative art.  Where does inspiration stop and plagiarism begin?  Does originality have a history? What happens to the image of the artist as a figure of solitary genius in works that make ample use of others' material, and where did that figure come from anyway?  We'll read theories of authorship, literary manifestos on behalf of unoriginality, novels about the pleasures and burdens of influence, recent re-workings of older literary texts, as well as a load of aggressively unoriginal works of literature---what we might call uncreative writing---while doing some uncreative writing of our own.  Finally, we'll consider the effect of media technology on art, as well as think through new considerations of copyright and intellectual property to gain some sense of originality's shifting status under the law.

And the language of my landscape is primarily that of the forest, which unceasingly bursts with life. I do not practice the economy of the meadow, I do not share the serenity of the spring."" These lines suggest not only that each landscape inspires unique textual expressions but also that differing forms of literary language constitute environments unto themselves. We will explore a number of such literary environments with the aim of investigating a) how literary works evoke and grapple with the sensual and atmospheric qualities of places, b) how environment has played a role in shaping literary forms and canons, and c) the ways in which experimental engagements with place have broadened and disrupted our ideas about both literature and geography.

In the twentieth-century, however, the work of younger artists and playwrights as diverse as Bertolt Brecht and Antonin Artaud provocatively suggested that theater itself could remedy the ills that Plato thought it aggravated by restoring to the people the productive power that the passively on-looking masses had ceded to the charisma of dictators. Today, as rapid changes in media daily transform the way in which we experience the world and understand our place within it, artists, critics, and philosophers continue to draw on the terms of historical debates about theater in attempts to understand the political significance of technologically enhanced forms of global spectatorship, asking what becomes of the traditional roles of viewers and directors on the new world-stage, in an age when revolutions are triggered by cell phone images, but advertising campaigns are also customized to consumers based on automated scans of private information like email. In this seminar, students take a historical approach to these urgent contemporary questions, analyzing the politics of theater in literature, criticism, film, and philosophy from antiquity to the present.

Revenge is inviting to literary and dramatic treatment partly because of its impulse towards structure: it traces a simple arc of injury and retaliation. A injures B, and B retaliates against A. But retaliation is never easy or equivalent, and there is always a volatile emotive mixture of loss and grievance that stirs up ethical ambiguities that are seldom resolved. Vengeance also fascinates because it is so paradoxical. The avenger, though isolated and vulnerable, can nevertheless achieve heroic grandeur by coming to personify nemesis. And yet the hero is always contaminated by trying to make a right out of two wrongs--and he usually has to die for it. Driven by past events, cut off from the present, and wrapped up in stratagems for future reprisals, the avenger's actions are almost always compromised by impotence or excess. At best, revenge is ""a kinde of Wilde Justice""--a justice that kills its heroes as well as its villains. We will look at as many stories of vengeance, across as wide a range of cultures and media, as possible.Readings will include Sophocles' <I>Electra</i>, Dante's <I>Inferno</I>, Shakespeare's <I>Hamlet</I> and <I>The Tempest</I>, Chalderon de Laclos' <I>Dangerous Liaisons</I>, and Vonnegut's <I>Slaughterhouse Five</I>, as well as several short stories and films.",seminar,two five page essays; one 10 page essay; several short response essays; 10% of grade is on participation,none,19,19,first-year students who have not taken or placed out of a 100-level English course,,,may not be taken on a pass/fail basis,,,Division 1,,,Writing Intensive,,,,,,,,,,,01,SEM,MWF,08:30,09:45,Pareksy 220,,,,,,,,,De Gooyer,Alan,,,,,,,,,,,ENGL, 135,1151

One outcome of this vast empire was the creation of a rich and diverse literary tradition in the English language--now called Anglophone literature--from far-flung places around the globe.

What's the secret?  Who is lying?  Who is quietly disregarding the rules?  The revelation of hidden knowledge--what Aristotle called anagnorisis--lies at the base of what drama is, and how theatre functions. Theatre is lying as much as lying is theatre.  So it should not be a surprise that playwrights often deliver plots and characters that pit playing against truth, and that oppose concealment and revelation as keys to dramatic action. But it should also not surprise that in the modern era, clarity in the dialectic of  ""truth and falsehood"" has eroded as well.  Relativity of honesty, contingency with regard to certain knowledge, ""truthiness""--these too have a place in the modern theatre.  This tutorial course will examine what lies hidden in American plays from the late nineteenth century to the early twenty-first.

Readings will include drama, poetry, fiction and non-fiction prose by Yeats, Synge, Joyce, George Moore, George Bernard Shaw, Lady Gregory, Douglas Hyde, Sean O'Casey and others. We will foreground key fault-lines of the period: competing visions of what constituted ""authentic"" Irish identity; debate over the propriety of writing in English, drawing on English literary traditions, or seeking a non-Irish audience; the work of ""self-exiles""such as Shaw and Joyce, versus that of writers who stayed in Ireland; and the long-entrenched ideological and political tensions between Catholics and Protestants, and Unionists and Nationalists. Throughout, we will consider the functions and efficacy of literature in promoting cultural and/or political change. The course will conclude by considering the extraordinary vitality of current Irish literary culture, with readings of work by Seamus Heaney, Colm Toíbín and Anne Enright, and discussion of Neil Jordan's film <I>The Crying Game</I>.

This course takes time to enjoy the special pleasures of novels of epic scope: the opportunity to immerse oneself in a wide and teeming fictional world; to focus sustained attention on the changeable fortunes of characters and societies over a long span of time; to appreciate the detailed grounding of lives in their social environment and historical moment; to experience the leisurely and urgent rhythms, with their elaborate patterning of build-ups and climaxes, that are possible in such works. We will read but two novels, both preoccupied with the disruption and evolution of lives and loves at moments of historic upheaval:<I> War and Peace</I> (1869), Leo Tolstoy's epic of the Napoleonic Wars, and <I>Parade's End</I> (1924-28), Ford Madox Ford's modernist masterpiece about World War I and its traumatic impact on English social life. Set a century apart, the novels are distinguished by vivid and scrupulous representation of their respective wars, by their shrewd accounts of political and social pressures informing the crises, and by their insight into the struggles of those whose lives are engulfed in global crisis. Tolstoy's and Ford's approaches to fictional representation, however, provide intriguing contrasts: one favors the lucidity of classic realism, the other the challenges of modernist innovation; one deploys a single multiplot novel, the other a tetralogy of shorter novels developing a single plot. We will discuss the differing strategies and effects of these two approaches, as well as the more general difficulties of reading and interpreting long fiction.

Fort Lee is on fire, and zombies are smashing down your parents' door. Catastrophe satisfies us on many levels; by contrast, the utopian vision provides a more delicate thrill. For a writer, the task is to provide a fiction that will not feel like a moral lesson or the illustration of some theory about how we should behave. This course will consider different utopian stories in turn, moving from Plato's <I>Republic </I>through the invented worlds of Thomas More, Margaret Cavendish, Edward Bellamy, and H.G. Wells, and then into the more contemporary science fiction of Kim Stanley Robinson, Ursula LeGuin, John Crowley, and others. Implicit in any kind of alternate reality is its creators' rejection of the place they live, and their corresponding longing for something new, which in all cases is as interesting as the way a story might work as a model for social improvement.  In addition to the occasional critical essay, students will invent a personal utopian fiction of about twenty to twenty-five pages, to be read and discussed by the class.",seminar,"two 5- to 7- page papers, and a 20- to 25-page piece of fiction","a 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam",19,19,at the discretion of the instructor,,,,,,Division 1,,,Writing Intensive,,,,,,,,,,,01,SEM,TF,02:35,03:50,,,,,,,,,,Park,Paul,,,,,,,,,,,ENGL, 236,1153

Subsequent decades in the United States witnessed the end of segregation, passage of Civil Rights, liberalization of immigration policies, and the rise and dominance of ""multiculturalism"" in social, political, and academic spheres.  These landmark events and shifts contributed to a narrative of progress as the defining story of race in post-war America.  However, as Winant cautions, the ""break"" neither resolved nor abolished racism and racial hierarchies.  Our class will examine how this narrative of racial progress has been constructed, as well as the ways in which it has been critiqued and complicated.  In doing so, we will also pay attention to: shifting perception(s) of race/racial difference in global and transnational contexts, representations of race in cultural texts and discourse, cross-racial connections and formations, and inter-articulation of gender, sexuality, and class formations with race.  This course reflects the goals of the Exploring Diversity Initiative through its comparative approaches to study of race and in its emphasis on the centrality of racial formations to the structure and logic of national life.",discussion/seminar,"active in-class participation, 3-4 short response papers, final project (8-10 pages) and an in-class workshop/presentation of final project",none,25,20,American Studies majors,,meets Division 2 requirement if registration is under AMST; meets Division 1 requirement if registration is under ENGL,,,,Division 2,Exploring Diversity,,,"AMST Comp Studies in Race, Ethnicity, Diaspora",ASAM Core Courses,,,,,,,,,,SEM,,,,,,,,,,,,,Um,Ji-Young,,,,,,,,,,,ENGL, 238,1123

Rather, this course will be an introduction to the different ways that literary critics have attempted to give a literary genre as loose, baggy, miscellaneous, and altogether hard-to-pin down as the novel a theoretical framework, to understand how the genre developed and how it functions. For the first couple of centuries of its existence in Britain and America, the novel was considered too popular, too commercial and unserious, and not sufficiently stylistically accomplished to merit anything like its own dedicated criticism or theory. Even now, critics can have a hard time even agreeing upon what a novel is, much less what constitutes a theory of the novel. Henry James, for example, said a novel's only duty was ""to be interesting,"" which, when you think about it, really casts a pretty broad and abstract generic net. Today, novel theory is legion. To only name a few, one can find theories of the novel that identify themselves as formalist, psychoanalytic, post-structuralist, Marxist, historical, and post-colonial, as well as accounts that emphasize sexuality and gender, for example, or the novel's trans-national development. Rather than try for an encyclopedic survey of either the novel or its theories, this course will use two or three novels as a means of testing out a range of representative works of novel theory. We will move back and forth from the theory of the novel to its practice in order to see how novel theory has developed over the past century, as well to see how the novel's own academic and popular fortunes relate to its theoretical accounts. Theorists are likely to include Henry James, Shklovsky, Benjamin, Lukacs, Barthes, Watt, McKeon, Jameson, D.A. Miller, Sedgwick, and Said. Novelists may include Austen, Dickens, George Eliot, or Henry James.",seminar,"4-5 papers; regular, substantial, and intensive participation in class","a 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam",19,19,sophomores and first-year students who have not yet taken an ENGL Gateway course,,,,,,Division 1,,,Writing Intensive,ENGL Criticism Courses,ENGL 200-level Gateway Courses,ENGL Literary Histories B,,,,,,,,01,SEM,TF,02:35,03:50,Schapiro Hall 137,,,,,,,,,Case,Alison,,,,,,,,,,,ENGL, 240,1151

Learning about several examples of life-writing including memoir, autobiography, testimonio, and the bildungsroman, students will question how literary form is linked not only to culture but also to the social, economic, and political conditions out of which authors and writings emerge. Common themes or narrative arcs across U.S. Cuban life-writing will be charted throughout the semester in order to understand the currency of particular stories of exile, displacement, and the American dream. The primary question of the course asks: how, and towards what ends, are the genres of life-writing utilized, adapted, and revised by those disavowed by the nation? Readings will include works by Eduardo Machado, Carlos Eire, Virgil Suarez, Gustavo Perez Firmat, Olga Karman, Evelio Grillo, Pablo Medina, Emilio Bejel, Mirta Ojita, and Emilio Estefan.

At the same time, a closer look at the canonical texts of ""high"" modernism reveals that the regional and local often suffuse these texts in surprising ways. This course will revisit the genre of regionalist writing with the aim of finding the avant-garde and the international within regionalist texts and, in turn, uncovering the unexpected regionalism of the modernist avant-garde. We will read works by authors such as Sarah Orne Jewett, Charles Chesnutt, Sherwood Anderson, Willa Cather, William Faulkner, T. S.

How is Latina/o literature marked by notions of language, nationality, gender, sexuality, class, race, politics, form, and genre?

This term has been used to describe works from Andy Warhol's paintings of Campbell's soup cans and Jean Baudrillard's critical essays on Disneyland to Thomas Pynchon's paranoid novel about postal conspiracy, <I>The Crying of Lot 49</I>. Theorists of the postmodern have argued that it represents not only a radical change in aesthetic sensibilities, but a fundamentally new relationship between art, language, and society. In this tutorial, we will read some of the most important theoretical essays defining the postmodern (essays which themselves often embrace this playful and sometimes ironic style), and we will pair them with artistic texts that are said to illustrate the features of postmodernism. The latter will be mainly novels and short stories from various countries, but one feature of this theory is a flattening of the distinction between high and low culture as well as between the written and the visual, so we will also examine examples from architecture, visual art, and/or broader pop culture. Along the way will ask whether global theoretical paradigms like postmodernism can help us understand other cultures better (by locating them within a single universal system), or whether this approach conceals important cultural differences. Texts will include essays by Jean Baudrillard, Fredric Jameson, Jean-François Lyotard, and others; novels and short stories by writers like Don DeLillo, Jorge Luis Borges, Italo Calvino, and Murakami Haruki; painting and sculpture associated with Pop Art and Superflat; the architecture of Williamstown area museums; etc. Writing assignments will focus on reading the theoretical texts critically and applying their ideas to the artistic texts in creative and interesting ways. Open to sophomores as well as advanced students.
Emphasis will be on understanding and engaging the criticism that we read, and comparing the critical and fictional texts creatively in a way that sheds light on both.","tutorial; after an introductory lecture meeting, students will meet with the instructor in pairs for approximately an hour each week",a 5-page paper every other week (five in all); responses to their partners' papers in alternate weeks,"a 100-level literature course (COMP, ENGL, etc.) and sophomore standing or higher, or permission of the instructor",10,10,students majoring in a discipline related to critical theory (or considering such a major) and those with a demonstrated interest in the material,,,may not be taken on a pass/fail basis,,,Division 1,Exploring Diversity,,Writing Intensive,ENGL Criticism Courses,,,,,,,,,,,TUT,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bolton,Christopher,,,,,,,,,,,ENGL, 266,1131

As the Life magazine example demonstrates, our visual cultural archives have served as both reflections of and active agents of social meanings, structures, and ideologies of race. We will approach visual cultures and archives of Asian America as not merely representations of race but as particular vehicles for cultural politics: How have visual cultural texts engaged with and shaped our ideas about Asia/America?

In this course we will explore the writings of Geoffrey Chaucer in order to study one of literary history's most versatile minds, and to introduce students to Middle English language and culture. One goal of the course is to encourage students to enjoy Chaucer: we will work towards this by emphasizing Chaucer's own playfulness in his texts, including his experimentation, his presentation of human difference, his elastic manipulation of philosophical ideas, his attention to the problems of translation, and his self-conscious consideration of narrative.

L. Austin and Stanley Cavell is often seen as one of the century's major philosophical movements. Yet the writing of all these figures remains relatively under-appreciated in literary studies. In this course we will address this shortcoming in two ways. First, we will examine some of the basic claims put forward in ordinary language philosophy, particularly as they compare and contrast with various contemporary literary-theoretical projects. Topics may include meaning and intention (Anscombe, Fish, Derrida, de Man, Michaels); experimental writing (R.M. Berry, Theodor Adorno); gender (Toril Moi, Judith Butler); emotion, affect, and expression (Deleuze, Terada, Leys, Altieri, Eldridge); and animals (Cora Diamond, Cary Wolfe).

For NASA and the government which supported it, the ability to fly men to outer space and return them safely was evidence for the power of a technocratic realism, in which time was linear, space homogenous, and stories ballistic in their trajectories. Simultaneously, however, Cold War geopolitics, rapid social change, and the creation of an electronic mass culture made such Newtonian realism seem an increasingly inadequate basis for representing the world. What kinds of language might prove able to express the experience of time, space, and speed opened up by a flight to the Moon?

In this course, students will explore the work of these authors and more, investigating music's ability to represent and critique African American culture in their literature. Texts will cover a range of literary forms including poetry, plays, short stories and novels alongside theoretical and critical essays. Students will discuss such key issues as assimilation into mainstream culture, authenticity claims on black music, and music used as a tool for protest.

Many oddities and ironies result from this curious history.  For example, African Americans as theatrical figures enter American consciousness via the minstrel stage, where white entertainers wearing burnt cork lampooned Negroes to amuse white audiences.   Eventually, black performers created their own versions of minstrelsy, black playwrights created dramas more sympathetic to black life, and representations of black life proliferated in every noteworthy medium. This course will consider how attitudes about blackness have informed or deformed theatrical representations of African American life.  It will examine major texts by African American writers, considering both their social importance and their aesthetic experiments and innovations.  It will range from politically oriented works of social realism such as Theodore Ward's <I>Big White Fog</I> and Lorraine Hansberry's <I>A Raisin in the Sun</I> to expressionistic protest works like Amiri Baraka's <I>Dutchman and Slave Ship</I> and Ntozake Shange's <I>For Colored Girls</I> to August Wilson's earnest histories and the post-modern satires of Adrienne Kennedy and Suzan-Lori Parks. 
 Alongside these, we will also consider a variety of comic traditions, ranging from minstrelsy to Spike Lee's film <I>Bamboozled</I> and characters created by comedians such as Jackie ""Moms"" Mabley and Richard Pryor.

For example, how did musician Sidney Bechet's migration from New Orleans to Chicago to London influence the early jazz era? How did Katherine Dunham's dance performances in Germany help her shape a new black dance aesthetic? Why did writer James Baldwin go all the way to Switzerland to write his first novel on black, religious culture in Harlem?

Lyric poems turn the most evanescent sensory experiences into words, giving them a seductive materiality that we can hear, see, touch, taste, and smell. Lyric poems are personal and communal, immediate and eternal, conversational and incantatory. ""A poem begins with a lump in the throat,"" Robert Frost remarks, for ""a complete poem is one where an emotion has found its thought, and the thought has found the words."" This course explores shifts in poetic conventions and material culture from Neoplatonic idealization to sexual seduction, from manuscript transmission to print and internet.

In the century when the genre first flourished, readers are the ultimate objects of novelists' plots. We are addressed, teased, pleaded with, embarrassed, flattered, made fun of, praised, chided, solicited, warned, reminded, rebuked, asked for sympathy, and-always-closely watched. Eighteenth-century novelists-and their narrators-aggressively educate their readers, not only teaching us how to interpret the novel itself, but also demanding that we self-consciously question the powers of mind and habits of heart we bring to the process of interpreting a book, ourselves, and our world. In this tutorial course, we will explore the narrative and rhetorical strategies two of the century's greatest novelists use in creating, shaping, and finally educating their readers. We will focus principally on Henry Fielding's <I>Tom Jones</I> (1749) and Laurence Sterne's <I>Tristram Shandy</I> (1760-67)--long, brilliantly intricate novels that go about their work in very different ways, but that are equally committed to the project of giving their readers a novel education. We will consider--much more briefly--Fielding's <I>Joseph Andrews</I> and Bunyan's <I>Pilgrim's Progress</I>. We will also read criticism by such ""reader response"" theorists as Stanley Fish and Wolfgang Iser, and--in the individualized setting of a tutorial--students will be asked to develop and articulate their own theories of reading by examining critically the ways in which texts affect and educate them.

Thus, the work is judged primarily in terms of its embodied sociological content (material, empirical) and not by ""abstract"" standards of aesthetic subtlety, philosophical sophistication, and so on. At the same time, in the popular and academic imaginary, minority subjects and artists poets occupy a single abstract signifying category--homogeneous, undifferentiated, ""other,"" marginalized, non-universal--while racially ""unmarked"" (white) artists occupy the position of being universal and individual at once. 
The irony, of course, is that, say, an African American poet's being read as an abstract signifier does not mean that the black subject or writer is seen as capable of engaging in abstract ideas. This course will ask questions about the problem of race and abstraction by looking at the work of various African American and Asian American writers, visual artists and musicians--including Will Alexander, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, David Hammons, Yayoi Kusama, Tan Lin, Nathaniel Mackey, and Cecil Taylor--as well as critics.

This course will examine some of their major fiction-- with an emphasis on Austen and Eliot-- in the context of recent critical debate about the nature and implications of  their narrative methods for representing the consciousnesses of characters, and of the authorial narrative voices that mediate among them. Questions to be considered: how is our understanding of novelistic characters and consciousness shaped by our real-life experience in interpreting the thoughts and character of others, and vice versa? Do ""omniscient"" narrators lay claim to a privileged kind of knowing presumed to be unavailable either to their character or to readers, or are they modelling humanly available interpretive stances toward a world of others?

In this course, we will think about what medieval texts can tell us about desire and how we might understand its modes within a wider perspective of a history of sexuality. In addition to investigating the theme of courtly love in medieval romance, we will explore troubadour poetry, saint's lives, theological treatises, courtesy manuals, and mystical visions. We will frame our investigation around some of the most influential narratives regarding the evolution of sexuality, including those of Michel Foucault, David Halperin and Karma Lochrie, in order to analyze how medieval texts uphold and sometimes challenge received notions about how, when, and whether these categories emerged. In our investigation, we will cover the paradox of virginity, the rise of a knightly class as an experiment in the homosocial, the poetics of desire, the sexuality of grammar, and more.

Romantic Literature is conventionally associated with the turn to nature, a convention that is well supported by the breathtaking landscapes and verdant microcosms that populate much of its poetry and prose. But what motivated this Romantic turn to nature, and how does it shape and or react to broader political, social and economic developments in the late Eighteenth- and early Nineteenth-centuries? Is the Romantic turn to nature a turn away from culture and politics, or is the relationship between nature and culture that Romantic texts reflect more complicated? Is Romantic nature of historical interest only, or might Romantic conceptions of nature offer us tools for confronting today's ecological dilemmas? We will consider such questions primarily through readings of the poetry and prose of canonized Romantic authors such as Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Mary and Percey Shelley, Keats, and Smith. We will also consider relevant excerpts from philosophical conceptions of nature that influenced British Romanticism, and developments in contemporary art and ""eco-criticism"" that arguably inherit, question, and transform Romantic conceptions of nature.",seminar,"three papers (one 4 pages, one 6 pages, and one 8-10 pages) and one presentation","a 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam",25,25,none,,,may not be taken on a pass/fail basis,,,Division 1,,,,ENGL Literary Histories B,"ENVI Humanities, Arts + Social Science Electives",ENVI Environmental Policy,,,,,,,,01,SEM,MR,02:35,03:50,Clark Hall 205,,,,,,,,,Johnston,Walter,,,,,,,,,,,ENGL, 331,1151

In this course we will try to understand the scope  of the nineteenth-century British novel's jaw-dropping  representational aspirations: its claim to comprehend in its pages  both the dizzying complexity of new social, political, and economic structures, as well as delineate in finest detail the texture of  individual minds and lives. We will pay attention to the fictional  modes by which apparently intractable social problems are resolved,  through a sleight of hand act we seem never to tire of, in the realm  of romantic love. And while we might think of the novel as an <I>Empire  of the Little</I>, endlessly occupied with giving significance to the smallest acts of ordinary human life, we will think about the  broader historical and social conditions the novel both represents  in its pages, and is a crucial not-so-silent partner in promoting  and contesting. We will also interest ourselves in the kind of under-the-counter work the Victorian novel does on behalf of British  empire, as well as empire's own behind-the-scenes work for the  novel.

We will read through this essential period of American literature by asking how key authors imagine the relationship between the self and its community. Does the individual exist in splendid isolation? Or are we terrifyingly open to the people around us? These texts will help us explore the politics of belonging as they played out in a nation headed toward Civil War and conscious of its fractures.

This course will consider two loosely affiliated artistic movements, aestheticism and decadence, as responses both scandalized and scandalizing to this exhilarating period.  Part of what's so tricky here is the elusiveness of the terms we'll be studying. So, much of our work will entail tracing out the multiple and often contradictory uses of them: do these terms designate a distinct cultural moment, an historically bounded period, a loose set of writers and artists, a theme?  Or, might we better conceptualize aestheticism and decadence as a style of writing or a style of the self, or even a mode of art that seeks to disrupt such distinctions as the one between the self and writing--one we might find in 21st-century New York as 19th-century London?  We'll read writers such as Oscar Wilde, who reveled in amoral manifestos like ""art for art's sake"" by elevating artifice and shallowness to first principles of life; but also Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, who has his own thing for artifice.  Noting the high body count in these works, we'll also ask why these texts seem so concerned with fatality, with death, with addiction, with various forms of losing the self--in art, in the metropolis, in another person. We'll focus as well on attempts to rethink traditional social bonds in works that value variously, solitude over sociality, the transient encounter over the enduring relationship, promiscuity over fidelity, and to think about how literary form might relate to those efforts.",seminar,"2 short papers, a series of shorter response papers, regular and substantial contributions to class discussions","a 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam",25,25,English majors,,,may not be taken on a pass/fail basis,,,Division 1,,,,ENGL Literary Histories B,,,,,,,,,,01,SEM,W,01:10,03:50,,,,,,,,,,McWeeny,Gage,,,,,,,,,,,ENGL, 344,1153

By 1904 the Irish Literary Theatre had evolved into the Abbey Theatre, a year-round professional company; and this in turn eventually became Ireland's National Theatre. This course will trace the evolution of modern Irish drama from these beginnings to the present day, with a core focus on work produced by the Abbey and its rivals.

If we can imagine a kind of literature that truly goes under the headings of ""World Literature,"" or ""Global Literature,"" what can we possibly exclude? Doesn't all literature belong to the world? What might we gain by using this term, and what might we lose? What histories are attached to the various names and classifications we assign to culture and how does cultural ""othering"" uphold or resist forms of economic, political, and military dominance? In this tutorial we will work carefully through the history and influential writings of postcolonialism as a particular challenge to hegemonic forms of representation, cultural production, and naming, starting with a close consideration of the writings of the movement's founders and key commentators, including Aimé Césaire, Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, Gayatri Spivak, Robert J.C.

Hamlet, the character who feigns madness, and whose rationality and feeling are also tested well beyond that feigning, has likewise haunted the Western literary canon, raising fundamental questions about self-performance and the value of language and rationality. This course will study Shakespeare's <I>Hamlet</I> and its legacies. We will consider its literary antecedents (including Kyd's <I>The Spanish Tragedy</I>) and the theatrical and historical contexts in which it was written, prior to comprehensive study of the play.  We will pay close textual and bibliographic attention to the differences between the two Quarto texts of 1603 of 1604 and the First Folio text of 1623, and to what these can tell us about performance and publication practices during the playwright's lifetime. Class exchanges with the Theatre Department production of the play will engage with questions of interpretation and performance for their work-in-progress.  We will also assess at least two film versions of the play.  The latter portion of the course will consider the ways <I>Hamlet</I> has haunted, and inspired, other writers over the past 400 years.

Whether as a religious, political or amorous posture, fanaticism is universally decried and never avowed. But what is fanaticism, and why should it be considered such a threat, particularly during a period that for the most part embraced an enlightened secular rationalism? In this course, we will explore these questions by considering literary texts that dramatize fanaticism in light of accounts by such philosophers and historians as Voltaire, Kant, Rousseau, Hobbes, Hume, Burke, Carlyle, Mill, and Adorno.  Literary readings will be drawn from works by Swift, de Stael, Shelley, Hogg, Dickens, Eliot, Hawthorne, Conrad, and Sinclair, as well as films by Dreyer, Riefenstahl, Le Roy and Pontecorvo, and drawings and engravings by Hogarth and Goya. While some of these works oppose fanaticism to enlightenment values, others see it as an effect of those values, which include sympathy, self-examination, and political flexibility. Since fanaticism has recently had considerable political currency, we will also consider some contemporary accounts that reanimate the debates and concerns of the course.",seminar,students will write one 6- to 8-page paper and one 10- to 12-page paper,"a 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam",25,25,junior and senior English majors,,,,,,Division 1,,,,ENGL Criticism Courses,ENGL Literary Histories B,,,,,,,,,01,SEM,W,01:10,03:50,Hopkins Hall 400 (Rogers Room),,,,,,,,,Sokolsky,Anita,,,,,,,,,,,ENGL, 355,1151

The Great War also provoked startling new modes of literature, as artists strove to respond to the unprecedented horrors of trench warfare and to traumatic social and political transformations.  In this course we will explore the War and the social and cultural upheavals it precipitated, as represented in historical texts and reflected in the poetry of Owen, Sassoon, Blunden, Graves, and Jones; in such novels as Remarque's <I>All Quiet on the Western Front</I>, Ford's <I>Parade's End</I>, Hasek's <I>The Good Soldier Svejk</I>, Hemingway's <I>A Farewell to Arms</I>, and Woolf's <I>Mrs. Dalloway</I>; and in films by such directors as Renoir, Milestone, Eisenstein, and Kubrick.  We will examine the contrasts in these texts between the War and the misleadingly idyllic years preceding it, and between the trenches and a domestic life which was tantalizingly nearby and psychically distant.

From Rabindranath Tagore's mystical poetry to Viaks Swarup's novel that inspired <I>Slumdog Millionaire</I>, the styles and aesthetics of Indian English are as vast as the peninsula itself, and the literature that has emerged from this diverse region has utterly reshaped contemporary global culture. ""Impossible India"" will introduce students to modern South Asian literature written in English. We will aim to discover how the writing of the so-called subcontinent has effected massive literary and theoretical transformations far beyond its boundaries in literary institutions around the globe. With an attention to shifting codes of ethnicity, race, religion, and other forms of identity within India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, as well as in the African, Caribbean, and American diasporas, the course is organized around the question of what makes South Asian literature South Asian, especially when we consider the South Asian novel in English. Major topics of discussion will include caste, gender, nationalism, globalization, cosmopolitanism, crime, and hybridity. Additionally, we will take up select contemporary criticism on subaltern studies, postcolonialism, and narratology. This class will be of interest to students curious about global perspectives on race and ethnicity, postcolonialism, the contemporary novel in English, and comparative literature. Authors will include Anand, Naipaul, Narayan, Suleri, Rushdie, Roy, Lahiri, as well as select works of poetry, film, and visual art.

That image, in fact, accurately describes our world in most places for most of its history. The greater part of the world's societies have gotten by just fine without literature. The question, then, is why anyone ever thought to open a theater in the first place -- or write a novel -- or print a collection of lyrics. We'll want to figure that out, and to explain, too, what kinds of societies are capable of hosting literature as we know it, and what kind of effects literature has upon such societies in turn: how poetry changes when it gets printed in books, how plays change when they get performed in front of ticket-holders, what kind of opportunities were opened up for writers in the generations around 1600, and equally, what new burdens were placed upon them. At one point, lyric poetry in English, the theater, and the novel were all new, and we'll need to know whether they had anything to do with the period's other new things: centralized governments, Protestantism, capitalism, science. We will read poems, plays, and at least one early novel, but our chief task will be to consider the competing accounts of these infant forms offered by contemporaries and later literary historians.",seminar,"two papers, totaling 20 pages or so; informal writing weekly; class attendance and participation","a 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam",25,25,,,,,,,Division 1,,,,ENGL Criticism Courses,ENGL Literary Histories A,,,,,,,,,01,SEM,TF,02:35,03:50,Stetson 508,,,,,,,,,Thorne,Christian,,,,,,,,,,,ENGL, 359,1151

We will discuss the ways in which compelling issues of character and theme (e.g., questions of heroism and betrayal, oedipal dynamics, sexuality and the politics of gender, civic engagement and artistic isolation, British imperialism and Irish nationalism) are placed in counterpoint with patterns drawn from myth, theology, philosophy, and other literature, and will consider the convergence of such themes in an unorthodox form of comedy. In assessing <I>Ulysses</I> as the outstanding paradigm of modernist fiction, we will be equally attentive to its radical and often funny innovations of structure, style, and narrative perspective. In addition to Joyce's novel, readings will include its epic precursor, Homer's <I>Odyssey</I>, as well as critical essays. Students unfamiliar with Joyce's short novel <I>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</I>, which introduces characters later followed in <I>Ulysses</I>, are urged to read it in advance of the course.",seminar,"active participation in class discussions, several group reports, a midterm exam, a 5-page paper, and an 8- to 10-page paper","a 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam",20,20,English majors,,,,,,Division 1,,,,ENGL Literary Histories C,,,,,,,,,,01,SEM,MR,02:35,03:50,,,,,,,,,,Tifft,Stephen,,,,,,,,,,,ENGL, 360,1153

Why are we taught to celebrate and embrace ""difference,"" but most often in terms closer to sheer tolerance than attraction? Can difference---or sameness---be characterized as a moral good? Politically, is difference a goal or an obstacle? How and where do we encounter the ""other"" in ways that change who we are? This course will probably not answer these questions tidily but will definitely bring them up over and over again, refining them through close reading of poetry, graphic novels, fiction, philosophy, and film from the latter half of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first. We will encounter literary works by Roland Barthes, Alison Bechdel, Junot Diaz, Marguerite Duras, Ariana Reines, Adrian Tomine, Monique Truong, as well as films by Rainer Warner Fassbinder, Isaac Julien, and Eric Rohmer. As we court these scintillating primary texts, we will also flirt with secondary authors in psychoanalysis, queer theory, feminism, black studies, and postcolonial studies. As the aim of our course is to explore and interrogate the notion of social difference itself, we will participate in the College's Exploring Diversity Initiative.

This course will be a joint adventure in the reception and production of such work, and is designed for anyone interested in the intersections of the creative and the socio-political. Our documentary models treat a range of subjects -- from a slave-ship massacre, to coal mining accidents in West Virginia and China, to American gun violence, to the impact of climate change -- yet all share both an investigative approach and a commitment to thinking about the way individual lives are shaped by larger social and historical structures. Generically, these works make use of the strategies of poetry, but also frequently incorporate essay, narrative, and image to create distinctly mixed forms. Students likewise will choose topics to investigate over the term, and their final projects will be printed through Publication Studio, an on-demand press in residency at WCMA in Fall 2014. 
As part of the Exploring Diversity Initiative, this tutorial engages questions of power and privilege, asking students to pursue an independent writing project that works empathically to understand a situation by uncovering its social, political, cultural, and historical contexts.

Such a re-framing, while potentially exciting, raises new questions. For example, what exactly is shared by subjects in a given diaspora? Does the term ""diaspora"" necessarily invoke the specter of racial essentialism? What happens to concepts of of race, racialization and racism when one moves away from local and national politics? Is the idea of a diasporic subject much less vexing than the idea of a racially minoritized person? How important a role does the shared English language play in these diasporas? In this course, we will look at the works of a specific diasporic literary group, English-language writers of Chinese descent, living in England, former British settler colonies (the United States, Canada, Australia) and other sites in Asia formerly colonized by the British.

Such literature is usually presumed to be inseparable from the ""identity""/body of the writer and read as autobiographical, ethnographic, representational, exotic. At the other end of the spectrum, avant-garde writing is seen to concern itself ""purely"" with formal questions, divorced from the socio-historical (and certainly not sullied by the taint of race). In the critical realm we currently inhabit, in which ""race"" is opposed to the ""avant-garde,"" an experimental minority writer can indeed seem an oxymoron. In this class we will closely read recent work by Asian American, African American, Native American and Latino/a writers which challenges preconceptions about ethnic literature, avant-garde writing, genre categorization, among other things. The writing done by these mostly young, mostly urban, poets and fiction writers is some of the most exciting being written in the United States today; their texts push the boundaries of aesthetic form while simultaneously engaging questions of culture, politics, and history.

Yet silent cinema represents an era of unparalleled transformation in which structures of narrative and the language of visual representation were virtually re-invented to meet the needs and the potentialities of a new medium, and the very relationship between art and entertainment was re-defined, producing hundreds of films that are the aesthetic equal of any contemporary work. The absence of synchronous sound allowed silent cinema a visual freedom that fostered forms of artistic experimentation unattainable in sound cinema, leading some aestheticians to proclaim the artistic superiority of silent cinema.  In this course we will survey classic narrative films by such directors as D. W. Griffith, Erich von Stroheim, and Abel Gance; stars of silent cinema such as Greta Garbo, Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and Rudolph Valentino; the flowering of American silent comedy in the work of Chaplin and Keaton; the creation of exciting new modes of political art by Eisenstein, Pudovkin, Vertov, and other directors of Soviet montage cinema; expressionist, surrealist, and other avant-garde work by such filmmakers as Murnau, Dulac, Man Ray, Buñuel, and Dreyer; and brilliant silent films by major directors better known for their sound films, such Ernst Lubitsch, Yasujiro Ozu, and Alfred Hitchcock.

Lorde was a queer feminist icon credited with furthering the concepts of intersectional identity and black feminism, while Baraka was accused throughout his career of obliviously brazen machismo and criticized for his use of homophobic invective.  Baraka endorsed the very notions of leadership and community from which Lorde crafted an identity of marginality, and Lorde endorsed a community-bound poetics contrasted to Baraka's avant-gardism. But for all their differences, Lorde and Baraka were arguably the two most significant African American writers of the late twentieth century, and, however surprisingly, they staked similar conceptual territory, addressing such themes as the possibility of spiritual self-discovery, the possibility of liberatory consciousness, the significance of emotions in building community, and the relationship between sexuality and racial identity. We will explore such issues by way of closely attending to their texts, and since another similarity between them was a prolific range of genre, we will have the opportunity to delve into poetry, essays, fiction, drama, and memoir, with a slight but definite preference for their poetry. We will also place these writers in their political and philosophical contexts, sampling secondary sources on the Black Arts movement, queer theory, contemporary American and African American poetry, and transnational black studies. As we will be discussing two writers whose collective contribution to minority discourse is nothing short of monumental, our course will participate in the College's Exploring Diversity Initiative.

But as the great theorist of children's animation and stoner movies Jack Halberstam has noted, sometimes failure turns out to be a better bet than success: it can reveal the blindspots of dominant ideologies, while opening up alternative ways of living in the world.  This course will take a long detour through meditations on failure emerging from queer theory, Asian American studies, and black studies, with a particular interest in what failure can reveal about higher education and related disciplinary institutions, such as prisons or the so-called ""internment camps"" for Japanese Americans during World War II.  This course fulfills the Exploring Diversity requirement by considering how the stigmatization of difference and justification of social inequality are inscribed in supposedly neutral rubrics of success and failure.
Readings may include Halberstam's <I>Queer Art of Failure</I>, Junot Diaz's <I>Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</I>, and works by Fred Moten, Roderick Ferguson, Angela Davis, Hisaye Yamamoto, Toshio Mori, Nella Larsen, Victor Lavalle, and others.

Is that truth hidden deep in our souls? Or is it the case that what you see, moment to moment, is all there is? We'll think through these aesthetic and psychological questions with a range of (mostly) nineteenth-century texts and an array of visual media.

Our texts will give us examples of the deadly male gaze (Poe), the mania for phrenology, the potential for daguerreotypes to reveal a villainous heart (Hawthorne), the existential and political consequences of passing (Larsen), the possibility that you are what you wear (James), and the promise of fingerprinting to prove who's who (Twain).

The course examines three historical incarnations of ""wonder,"" each involving complex relations among the aesthetic, philosophical, and social domains: the Renaissance tradition of wonder and the marvelous; the eighteenth-century analysis of the sublime; and twentieth-century accounts of the culture of spectacle.

Academic psychologists, meanwhile, have shown that we're really bad at identifying what will make us happy; we think we know, and we're usually wrong. Some living philosophers have concluded that we don't even know what the word means. In this seminar, we'll have to ask all the hard questions: What is happiness? What makes people happy? How do you decide what kind of life is worth living? Does happiness change from society to society or culture to culture? Is there a politics to happiness? What, if anything, does happiness have to do with justice? Why does the song tell you to clap your hands ""if you're happy <I>and you know it</I>""? Is it possible to be happy and not know it?

What would a community founded on such a conception of justice look like? Can we imagine a version of community not founded on exclusion? What would the members of such a community look like--what version of subjectivity would that community imply?  And might literature in particular have something to say about the possibilities for such versions of community, selfhood, and justice? This course will look at recent, theoretically-oriented writing on justice and community, with an emphasis on the work of Hannah Arendt, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Luc Nancy and Giorgio Agamben. No prior knowledge of these writers is expected, but the course does require a willingness to wrestling with demanding (and rewarding) theoretical argument. We will place the philosophical work in relation to fiction from Euripides to Kafka, films (Resnais, Farhadi), photography (Silva, <I>Badlands</I>) and worldly examples of competing claims to justice. 
The course pursues the aims of the EDI initiative in part by engaging works in which cultural differences reveal the limits of universalizing accounts of law and justice, works such as Euripides' <I>Bacchae</I>, Nuruddin Farah's <I>Maps</I>, Louise Erdrich's poetry, and Farhadi's <I>A Separation</I>. But the course will equally suggest that such contingency is inherent in the concept of justice as such, insofar as the problem of justice is bound up with forms of constituting indebtedness that define humans as communal beings. In that sense, contingency and difference mark justice even in its most familiar instances--intimately and close to home, as it were.",seminar with tutorial sessions,"one 5-page paper, and a final 15-page paper",300-level English course or permission of instructor,15,15,"English majors, students who have taken Criticism/Theory course in any discipline",,,,,,Division 1,Exploring Diversity,,,ENGL Criticism Courses,JLST Interdepartmental Electives,,,,,,,,,01,SEM,TF,02:35,03:50,Stetson 501,,,,,,,,,Pye,Christopher,,,,,,,,,,,ENGL, 407,1151

Building on this foundation, we will investigate the profound methodological impact of feminist and queer literary criticism.  We will examine the ways in which such scholarship has not only challenged the neglect of gender and sexuality but also generated new theoretical frameworks and approaches to interpretation. Our investigation will be guided by questions such as: What is the relationship between feminist and queer theories and other interpretive approaches such as new criticism, poststructuralism, psychoanalysis, critical race theory, new historicism, and postcolonial theory? In what ways do feminist and queer theories differ and disagree about literary studies? What constitutes a feminist reading practice or queer method of interpretation?

Students will give close attention to a single theorist or philosophical school or perhaps to a single question as taken up by several theorists. Prior coursework in critical theory or continental philosophy, no matter the department, is strongly recommended. The subject of this semester's seminar is Jacques Derrida. We often think of language as best when it is living and intimate: words spoken to a lover, arguments shared around a seminar table, the poet we finally get to hear read her works out loud. But it is Derrida's signature argument that language is never really intimate in these ways -- that it is always adrift, separated at once from the person who speaks or writes it, from the person to whom it is addressed, and from the things in the world that it putatively names. The words you speak and write aren't really yours; nor can you ever be sure they will carry the meanings you intend them to have; nor can you guarantee that they will reach the people for whom they were devised, or that they will reach only them. Derrida's core claim is that this is nothing to worry about -- that, on the contrary, a liberated philosophy will have to keep faith with a language thus unfixed. We will spend the semester considering this idea and reckoning its consequences for our understandings of literature, metaphysics, ethics, politics, and law.",seminar,seminar paper of 25 pages; informal weekly writing; class attendance and participation,"a 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam; prior coursework in critical theory or continental philosophy, no matter the department, is strongly recommended",15,15,seniors with background in critical theory,,,may not be taken on a pass/fail basis,,,Division 1,,,,ENGL Criticism Courses,,,,,,,,,,01,SEM,TF,02:35,03:50,,,,,,,,,,Thorne,Christian,,,,,,,,,,,ENGL, 456,1153

This class emphasizes the influence of climatic, tectonic, and volcanic forces on landform evolution over relatively short periods of geologic time, generally thousands to a few millions of years.  At this time scale, the influence of human activity and climate change on landforms may be strong, perhaps dominant, in many geologic environments. Many of our examples analyze human interaction¿planned or unplanned-- with geomorphic processes.

In fact, core economic theories predict that people and firms, left to their own devices, will often tend to pollute too much, conserve too little, overfish common waters, and cut down too many trees. These predictions seem to be borne out by the world's environmental problems. Fortunately, economics offers tools to address these issues, and these tools are increasingly gaining attention in the policy world. In this course, we will survey environmental and natural resource economics, fields that work to inform policy with attention to both natural assets and human needs. We will focus on real-world problems, mostly from a microeconomic perspective. Underlying issues in these fields include: why markets might be inefficient where the environment and natural resources are concerned; whether and how to value the benefits we receive from the environment; and how to carefully evaluate policies. We will study the economists' perspective on sustainability and we'll discuss how sustainability, growth, and human wellbeing relate to each other. We will study the use of non-renewable resources (like oil) and renewable resources (like trees and fish), and we will spend some time talking about energy and energy policy. We will examine issues related to pollution, looking at traditional ""command and control"" regulations and at market-based pollution control policies.

Remote sensing allows regional mapping of rock materials, analysis of vegetation cover and measurement of urban areas and land-use change over time. A Geographic Information System (GIS) links satellite-based environmental measurements with spatial data such as topography, transportation networks, and political boundaries, allowing display and quantitative analysis at the same scale using the same geographic reference. This course covers concepts of remote-data capture and geographic rectification using a Global Positioning System (GPS), as well as principles of remote sensing, including linear and non-linear image enhancements, convolution filtering, and image classification.

Does public ownership of water improve the way it is provided and used? Why do societies differ in their approaches to allocating water and are some systems better than others? What does it mean to have a property right to water? Could private property rights to water help address the water pollution problem?

Rivers build land and destroy land: they transport the sediment and nutrients that construct agricultural land, and sometimes they flood that land. In this course we will consider a wide range of questions about rivers: How do they form?  Where does the water come from?  Where does the water go?  How do rivers erode their banks and carve their channels? How do they move sediments?  What is the chemistry of river water?  How do our activities change river chemistry, and how does that affect the environment? When, how, and why do rivers flood?  How can we predict and  control flooding?

In this class, we will consider the efforts of both canonical and contemporary political theorists to fashion political principles suited to organizing the comportment of human communities towards non-human nature.  The texts we read will prompt us to question common presuppositions about human nature and the material settings of political life. They will also challenge us to reconsider the actors, spaces, and knowledge that constitute politics.

Since 2008, the ""Great Recession"" has been disastrous not only for Americans' financial well-being, but also for the political will to take action on climate change (to name just one environmental issue). But it wasn't always this way. The 1930s, one of the most traumatic decades of the twentieth century in America, actually spurred environmentally-conscious action in an economic context far worse than what we are experiencing today. Why? This class will explore the many ways Americans understood their diverse local environments and took action to save them during the Great Depression. Although the Dust Bowl is perhaps the most iconic of these environmental upheavals during the 1930s, this course will explore diverse geographical regions: from the Appalachian mountains to the (de)forested Upper Midwest, from the agricultural South to the Dust Bowl plains and the water-starved West. In each region, we will trace the impacts of economic turmoil on the environment and the people who depended on it for their livelihoods, as well as the way the economic disaster paved the way for the federal government's unprecedented intervention in environmental matters.

Rather than argue for or against globalization, we first examine the nature of this new configuration and its relation to (post)modernity, asking questions such as: What are the cultural and social dynamics of globalization? What are the effects on the nature of the state and the political practices that take place in the global world? What are its environmental consequences? We then shift to examining the role of religion, arguing that its renewed relevance is a function of the socio-cultural transformations that globalization brings about, particularly the loss of community and the increasing atomization of individuals. We conclude by examining some of the perspectives created by the new religious expressions that attempt to respond to this situation, from personal spiritual quests as manifested in interest in Buddhism, ecology or mountain climbing, to various forms of fundamentalism, such as Evangelicalism, the fastest growing religious movement in the Americas, and the most radical forms of Islamicism.

For answers, we will look to the writings of thinkers such as John Muir, Edward Abbey, Rachel Carson, Aldo Leopold, and Wendell Berry, as well as a number of lesser-known authors. We will read these authors alongside recent scholarship in the social sciences and humanities to understand how their thinking was influenced by social and environmental trends such as urbanization, industrialization, immigration, and globalization.

Through this course we will lay conceptual and theoretical foundations for understanding the productions of place, nature, food and agriculture, and the interconnections among them. How do socially constructed ideas about nature, agrarian landscapes, and even particular environmental qualities such as soil and water, shape the formation of categories such as city, country, and region or even of specific food products? Through what processes do particular food products come to be distinctively place-based? How do we understand the seeming shift to place-based agriculture and food production, in the context of an industrialized and increasingly intricate global food system that has often homogenized and standardized food production? How is locality produced through food and agriculture, and how are food and agriculture produced through claims to locality and place? These interconnections, and the relations of power interlaced in them, are salient in contemporary praxis, and the course builds on grounded, conceptual understandings to explore contemporary phenomena such as the <I>appellation d'origine contrôlée</I> in France's wine producing regions, the development of Geographic Indication within the World Trade Organization, the formation of ""Organic Uttarakhand"" that is the subject of my own research, and the affective economies generated through artisanal food production.

Romantic Literature is conventionally associated with the turn to nature, a convention that is well supported by the breathtaking landscapes and verdant microcosms that populate much of its poetry and prose. But what motivated this Romantic turn to nature, and how does it shape and or react to broader political, social and economic developments in the late Eighteenth- and early Nineteenth-centuries? Is the Romantic turn to nature a turn away from culture and politics, or is the relationship between nature and culture that Romantic texts reflect more complicated? Is Romantic nature of historical interest only, or might Romantic conceptions of nature offer us tools for confronting today's ecological dilemmas? We will consider such questions primarily through readings of the poetry and prose of canonized Romantic authors such as Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Mary and Percey Shelley, Keats, and Smith. We will also consider relevant excerpts from philosophical conceptions of nature that influenced British Romanticism, and developments in contemporary art and ""eco-criticism"" that arguably inherit, question, and transform Romantic conceptions of nature.",seminar,"three papers (one 4 pages, one 6 pages, and one 8-10 pages) and one presentation","a 100-level ENGL course, or a score of 5 on the AP English Literature exam, or a score of 6 or 7 on the Higher Level IB English exam",25,25,none,,,may not be taken on a pass/fail basis,,,Division 1,,,,ENGL Literary Histories B,"ENVI Humanities, Arts + Social Science Electives",ENVI Environmental Policy,,,,,,,,01,SEM,MR,02:35,03:50,Clark Hall 205,,,,,,,,,Johnston,Walter,,,,,,,,,,,ENVI, 331,1151

This course will consider the inter-related nature of Earth and the life that inhabits it, starting with the first living organisms and progressing to the interaction of our own species with the Earth today. Students will investigate the dynamic nature of the Earth-life system, examine many of its feedbacks, and learn about the dramatic changes that have occurred throughout the history of the Earth. We will ask questions such as: How did the Earth facilitate biologic evolution, and what effects did those biologic events have on the physical Earth?  When did photosynthesis evolve, how can we detect that in the rock record, and how did this biological event lead to profound changes in the environment? How and why did animals evolve and what role did environmental change play in the radiation of animal life? How did the rise and radiation of land plants affect world climate? How do plate tectonics, glaciation, and volcanism influence biodiversity and evolutionary innovation? What caused mass extinctions in the past and what can that teach us about our current extinction crisis? Labs will involve hands-on analysis of rocks, fossils, and real-world data as well as conceptual and analytical exercises; field trips will contextualize major events in Earth history and will help students learn to read the rock record. Through these investigations, the class will provide a comprehensive overview of Earth history, with special attention paid to the geological and paleontological history of the northeastern United States.",lecture; one laboratory per week plus one all-day field trip,"evaluation will be based on lab work, short quizzes, midterms, a writing project, and a final exam",none,30,30,underclassmen,,,,,,Division 3,,,,ENVI Natural World Electives,ENVS Group EB-B Electives,ENVS Group EG-A Electives,GEOS Earth Surface Processes + Life Courses,,,,,,,01,LEC,MWF,10:00,10:50,Clark Hall 105,,,,,,,,,Cohen,Phoebe,,,,,,,,,,,GEOS, 101,1151

In a geological time frame, nothing on Earth is permanent: ocean basins open and close, mountains rise and fall, continental masses accrete and separate. There is a message here for all of us who live, for an infinitesimally brief time, on the moving surface of the globe. This course uses the plate tectonics model--one of the fundamental scientific accomplishments of the past century--to interpret the processes and products of a changing Earth. The emphasis will be on mountain systems (on land and beneath the oceans) as expressions of plate interactions. Specific topics include the rocks and structures of modern and ancient mountain belts, the patterns of global seismicity and volcanism, the nature of the Earth's interior, the changing configurations of continents and ocean basins through time, and, in some detail, the formation of the Appalachian Mountain system and the geological assembly of New England.

This class emphasizes the influence of climatic, tectonic, and volcanic forces on landform evolution over relatively short periods of geologic time, generally thousands to a few millions of years.  At this time scale, the influence of human activity and climate change on landforms may be strong, perhaps dominant, in many geologic environments.

Remote sensing involves collection and processing of data from satellite and airborne sensors to yield environmental information about the Earth's surface and lower atmosphere. Remote sensing allows regional mapping of rock materials, analysis of vegetation cover and measurement of urban areas and land-use change over time. A Geographic Information System (GIS) links satellite-based environmental measurements with spatial data such as topography, transportation networks, and political boundaries, allowing display and quantitative analysis at the same scale using the same geographic reference. This course covers concepts of remote-data capture and geographic rectification using a Global Positioning System (GPS), as well as principles of remote sensing, including linear and non-linear image enhancements, convolution filtering, and image classification. Principles of GIS include display and classification, spatial buffers, logical overlays and techniques of spatial analysis.

This interest reflects both concern over future climate changes resulting from anthropogenic increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases and growing recognition of the economic impact of ""natural"" climate variability (for example, El Niño events), especially in the developing world. Efforts to understand the Earth's climate system and predict future climate changes require both study of parameters controlling present day climate and detailed studies of climate changes in the past. In this course, we will review the processes that control the Earth's climate, like insolation, the greenhouse effect, ocean circulation, configuration of continents, and positive and negative feedbacks . At the same time, we will review the geological record of climate changes in the past, examining their causes.

Ocean currents redistribute heat and water vapor around the globe, controlling temperature and precipitation patterns. Marine phytoplankton blooms and air-sea gas exchange modulate the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. The dynamic interaction of the atmosphere and the sea surface results in multi-year climate variations such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. This course will examine gradual and abrupt climate shifts from Earth's history and the ocean's role in driving, amplifying or dampening the changes, the ocean's response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, and the projected impacts of continued emissions and climate change on the ocean in the coming decades and millennia. We will analyze articles from the scientific literature that lay out the theory on the ocean's influence on climate, reconstruct past climate and ocean changes, test the mechanisms responsible for those changes, and with that knowledge, project the consequences of continued anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.

They fill our reservoirs, carry shipping, provide electrical power and feed millions of people. Rivers flush away our waste, potentially profoundly affecting the ocean.  Rivers build land and destroy land: they transport the sediment and nutrients that construct agricultural land, and sometimes they flood that land. In this course we will consider a wide range of questions about rivers: How do they form?  Where does the water come from?  Where does the water go?  How do rivers erode their banks and carve their channels? How do they move sediments?  What is the chemistry of river water?  How do our activities change river chemistry, and how does that affect the environment? When, how, and why do rivers flood?  How can we predict and  control flooding?  What happens when rivers reach the ocean?  How do rivers evolve over time, and how does that affect people and their livelihoods?

Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Germany and Austria, profound interiority surfaced frequently to challenge--and even threaten--what was touted as the triumph of objective, scientific thought. At the same time, the writers and thinkers who explored the deepest recesses of the mind were beset by alienation and despair as they were drawn into inevitable conflict with dominant paradigms.

A closer look at artworks by Otto Dix, Christian Schad, and Hannah Höch, films by Fritz Lang and Georg Wilhelm Pabst, poems by Gottfried Benn, Else Lasker-Schüler, and Kurt Tucholsky, novels by Erich Kästner, Vicky Baum, and Irmgrad Keun, as well as plays by Frank Wedekind and Bertolt Brecht, will provide a more precise picture of the New Woman's various incarnations, ranging from actresses (Marlene Dietrich), singers (Margo Lion and Claire Waldorf), and dancers (Anita Berber) to prostitutes, and suggest that the New Woman serves as the vessel of male anxieties and represents the contradictions of modernity. <I>Taught in German.</I>",taught seminar style in German for the German students and as a tutorial in English for non German speaking students,papers and oral presentations,for students taking it in German: GERM 201 or the equivalent; for students taking the course in English: one college-level literature course,19,8,,,,,,,Division 1,,,Writing Intensive,,,,,,,,,,,01,SEM,TR,09:55,11:10,Hollander 241,,,,,,,,,Kone,Christophe,,,,,,,,,,,GERM, 317,1151

Nevertheless, actual travel narratives--narratives about the actual physical visits of writers to distant lands--call for careful and critical analysis because they can be seductive, and they can shape the ways we think about the present--and the past--of distant lands and cultures. This course discusses Arab, Indian, European, African and African American travel narratives about various regions of Africa since the 14th century. We will mine the travel accounts for descriptions of local contexts. We will also explore what travel writing says about the author's perceptions of self, home, and ""other.""

Rapid urbanization and industrialization, and the spread of education and literacy, gave rise to social conflict and dislocation, demands for social reform, and the redefinition of individual identities and beliefs.

For instance, why is it important to some people to imagine that Pocahontas lived happily ever after with John Smith, or that Squanto gave us the first Thanksgiving? Such national myths are based on kernels of historical reality, but they also elide important details and oversimplify the lives of both Native and European protagonists. By learning more about the complex Native individuals behind the stereotypes, we will face our assumptions, identify the cultural work these images perform, and question why certain portrayals of Native peoples continue to thrive.

The study of ancient Greece indeed requires an interpretive framework, yet Greek culture and history have defied most attempts to articulate one. We will make our attempt in this course by investigating ancient Greece as a set of cultures surprisingly foreign to us, as it so often was to its own intellectual elite. But we will also come to appreciate the rich and very real connections between ancient Greek and modern Western civilization. The course will begin with Bronze Age-Greece and the earliest developments in Greek culture, and will conclude with the spread of Greek influence into Asia through the conquests of Alexander the Great.

Scholars have looked to Rome both for actual antecedents of European cultural development and for paradigmatic scenes illustrating what they felt were cultural universals. Yet Roman history also encompasses the most far-reaching experience of diverse cultures, beliefs, and practices known in the Western tradition until perhaps contemporary times. A close analysis of Roman history on its own terms shows the complex and fascinating results of an ambitious, self-confident nation's encounter both with unexpected events and crises at home, and with other peoples. As this course addresses the history of Rome from its mythologized beginnings through the reign of the emperor Constantine, it will place special emphasis on the impressive Roman ability to turn the unexpected into a rich source of cultural development, as well as the complex tendency later to interpret such <I>ad hoc</I> responses as predestined and inevitable. The Romans also provide a vivid portrait of the relationship between power and self-confidence on the one hand, and violence and ultimate disregard for dissent and difference on the other.

The primary goal of the course is to help students understand the social and historical context in which Roman material culture was created and used. We will consider a variety of evidence from across the empire, including monumental and domestic architecture, wall painting, mosaics, sculpture, coins and inscriptions. Special emphasis will be placed on the city of Rome; however, we will also look at other important urban centers, such as Pompeii, Aphrodisias and Lepcis Magna.  Roman art and architecture were not the product of any single people or culture, but rather the hybrid synthesis of complex cultural negotiations between the Romans and their colonial subjects (i.e., Greeks, Jews, Celts, etc.).  Class discussions will focus on issues related to gender, ethnicity and cultural identity in the Roman Empire.  For example, we will explore what it meant to be ""Roman"" in terms of language, ethnicity and cultural institutions.

We will then study the imposition of Iberian rule from the point of view of would-be colonizers and the peoples they treated as objects of colonization, stressing the multiple and conflicting character of European, indigenous, and African perspectives. Thus looking at the Americas from both the outside-in and inside-out, we will focus on the unequal relations of power that came to define cultural, political, and economic life in the colonies, always with an eye on the gendered and racialized nature of those relations.

This course will examine the modern history of that country of the future by taking up major themes from independence to the present.

Amidst these events, U.S. statesmen and citizens constantly debated the country's proper diplomatic role and struggled to construct and propagate a unique American ideology, as well as an advantageous geo-strategic position, on the global stage.

Such an audacious project of collection has rarely been attempted either before or since.  At its height, the Great Library was reputed to house over 700,000 books from across the Greek world, as well as many translations of texts originally written in Latin, Hebrew, Egyptian, and even Sanskrit.  Attracted by the vast stores of knowledge, scholars, artists, and poets flocked to the Great Library to create one of the most vibrant intellectual communities the world has ever known.  In this course, we will examine the development and influence of the Great Library and its sister institution, the Mouseion (or ""Museum"") from a variety of cultural and historical perspectives.  We will begin by exploring the political motives of the Ptolemaic kings and their reception of earlier traditions of collecting in the Greek and Near Eastern worlds.  We will then turn to the intellectual and artistic activity at the Library itself, with special attention to the development of notions of connoisseurship and canon across various disciplines.  Although implicated in the Ptolemies' political agenda, the scholars living and working in the Great Library were granted extraordinary freedom to pursue new ideas that transformed literature, science, and the arts forever.

Among the most common supernatural crimes is witchcraft, which societies can invoke to explain natural disasters and disease, and to blame these occurrences on specific individuals, often social outcasts. Witchcraft became a particular focus of fear and fascination in Early Modern Europe, when inquisitors, theologians and many ordinary people came to believe that Western Christendom was threatened by a vast, covert conspiracy of witches in league with the devil. Countless ""witches""--most of them women--were accordingly tried, tortured and sometimes even executed. Our course will examine these bizarre events and consider what religious, cultural and intellectual factors might help explain them. We will begin by investigating the medieval legal and theological developments that enabled and encouraged the persecution of witches, and go on to study some of the most important and sensational witch trials of the later medieval and early modern periods. Throughout, we will encounter many strange and intriguing documents produced by the inquisitors who persecuted witches, the scholars who imagined their activities, and the laws that defined their crimes.

In the 1950s, sociologists argued about the extent to which postwar affluence was leading to the ""embourgeoisement"" of the working class; in the 1960s, the advent of the so-called ""Permissive Society"" witnessed the flourishing of a new culture of sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll; in the 1970s, the feminist and gay movements challenged gender roles that earlier had seemed so secure; in the 1980s, Thatcherism sought to halt the nation's apparent terminal decline, repudiating much of the progressive legislation of earlier decades; finally, throughout this period successive ways of immigration challenged the cultural homogeneity of white Britain. This course will explore these themes, addressing the question of what it meant to be ""postwar"" in Britain, charting the gradual emergence of a new politics of class, gender, race, and sexuality in Britain that the made the nation in 1990, at the end of the postwar period, a radically different place from what it had been in 1945.

Octavian's victory at battle of Actium in 31 BCE officially brought an end to the Roman civil wars, but it did not in itself unify the empire. Out of this matrix of social fragmentation and uncertainty arose the geographical texts of the Augustan age. The genre of universal geography provided a convenient means to reconfigure identity boundaries in post-Actium world. By delineating stable borders between the peoples and provinces, geographical texts (whether written, sculptural or pictorial) literally mapped out identity boundaries and power relationships to create a new, unified image of the Roman Empire. This course examines the political and cosmological of implications geographical sources produced under the Roman Empire, including the <I>Res Gestae</I> of Augustus, Strabo's <I>Geography</I> and Tacitus' <I>Germania</I>. We will also look at maps and other visual representations of the Roman world, such as the personification groups depicted on the Roman imperial cult temples at Aphrodisias and Pisidian Antioch.

Still others argue that British political institutions failed to adapt to the needs of a growing empire, leading colonists to replace British imperial rule with a form of government suited to their local exigencies. Some have told the story through the eyes of the Founding Fathers, while others have explored what the American Revolution meant for the lived experience of average citizens, of women, of free and enslaved African Americans, of Native Americans, and of peoples living beyond North America.

Students will learn about the unique legal landscape in Indian Country by charting the historical development of tribal governments and the ever-changing body of U.S. law and policy that regulates Indian affairs. We begin by studying Indigenous legal traditions, the European doctrine of discovery, and diplomatic relations between Native nations and European empires. We then shift our focus to treaty-making, the constitutional foundations of federal Indian law, 19th century U.S. Supreme Court decisions, and the growth of the federal bureaucracy in Indian Country. The course devotes considerable attention to the expansion of tribal governmental authority during the 20th century, the contemporary relationship between Indian tribes and the federal/state governments, and the role of federal Indian law as both a tool of U.S. colonial domination and a mechanism for protecting the interests of Indigenous communities.

The class follows the development of ""whiteness"" through a chronology that begins in colonial Virginia, travels through immigration in the nineteenth century, examines racial politics and popular culture in the twentieth century, and  ends  with a look at the current election season. This course is framed by several questions: What is whiteness, and what has it meant in the history of the United States? Who is (and is not) white? What about other analytical categories, like gender and class (or region or ethnicity or sexuality): how have these experiences shaped and been shaped by the racial category of whiteness? Because historically whiteness has carried overtones of power, privilege, and wealth in the United States, the course necessarily critiques the roots of racial disparities.

It follows that political leadership---whether exercised by elected officials or community activists---represents a vital instrument by which people may attempt to shape the social processes that structure their communities and their everyday lives.  Seldom have American communities had greater need for creative and effective leadership than did American cities following the Second World War---yet seldom has  this kind of leadership proven more difficult to realize.  In the postwar years, cities, the drivers of the nation's phenomenal economic growth for nearly a century, confronted a host of new challenges: declining private investment; the out-migration of their middle and upper classes and, consequently, a new position as sites of concentrated poverty; persistent fiscal crises; seemingly endless ethno-racial conflict; and the rise of new epidemics---drug use, AIDS, and mass incarceration.  By the mid-1960s, these challenges had come together in the public discourse to signify a general ""urban crisis.""  This course will introduce students to the processes that have shaped American urban life since the Second World War (some of which, we will see, were in fact far from ""automatic"").  We will also examine how public officials and community leaders tried to intervene to shape those processes, what resources they could muster for doing so, and what came of their efforts---so as better to understand the possibilities and the limits of leadership in hard times.  What kinds of leadership are possible when a zero-sum logic obtains, when social ""problems"" prove ""insoluble,"" when ""positive"" action appears impossible?

Course materials will focus primarily on Vietnam's domestic politics and its relations with other countries.

The impact of these wars can hardly be overstated, as they affected the trajectory of French decolonization, altered America's domestic politics and foreign policy, invigorated anti-colonial movements across the Third World, and left Vietnam isolated in the international community.

It will explore the origins and rise of Italian fascism, German National Socialism, and Japanese militarism; the political cultures of charisma, violence, terror, collaboration, and resistance; racism and anti-Semitism; and fascist aesthetics. We will also consider how these phenomena shaped, and were shaped by, the nature of everyday life in this decade with particular attention to issues of religion, family, and gender.

This course seeks to answer these questions by focusing on the oldest maritime highway in history: the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean connected diverse regions, cultures and communities for millennia, thus making it a vital element in the birth of globalization. South Asian ports and port cities remained the fulcrum of the Indian Ocean world throughout its history; traders, travellers, nobles, scholars, pilgrims and pirates from all over the world travelled to the Indian coast in search of adventure, spices, knowledge and wealth. Thus we will primarily focus on India's role in the Indian Ocean roughly from the rise of Islam in the seventh century CE through the intrusion of various European communities in the region and the subsequent rise of the global economy and colonialism in the nineteenth century. Rather than following a strict temporal chronology we will concentrate on themes such a travel and adventure; trade and exchange; trust and friendship; religion and society; pilgrimage; piracy; the culture of port cities; and food across time.",seminar,"evaluation will be based on participation, response papers based on primary sources, and two essays",none; open to all,25,15-20,none,,,,,,Division 2,,,,HIST Group B Electives - Asia,INST South + Southeast Asia Studies Electives,MAST Interdepartmental Electives,,,,,,,,,SEM,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kapadia,Aparna,,,,,,,,,,,HIST, 391,1141

And in the study of diasporic peoples and cultures, the Jews have long figured as the archetype. Indeed, prior to the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948, the diasporic condition both defined and, in a meaningful way, was defined by the Jewish experience. As a result, Jewish political figures, intellectuals, and scholars have played a central role in discussions of the meaning of diaspora, including debates about its political and social implications, economic value, and cultural significance. This seminar examines various interpretations of Jews' diasporic existence from the nineteenth century to the present, both as a cultural practice and a form of group identity from which political claims have been made. Ultimately, this seminar will test the proposition that ""The Modern Age is the Jewish Age,"" that is, that the meaning of diaspora in modern Jewish history has direct relevance to students of human identity, not just of Jewishness.

Increased religious tolerance and pluralism have coexisted with intense anti-clericalism, militant secularism, virulent anti-Semitism, and Islamophobia; religious revival and reform have coexisted with skepticism, secularization, and dechristianization; both religion and irreligion have served as bases for political mobilization and powerfully shaped personal, national, and transnational identities. According to some scholars, Europe demonstrates a long-term trajectory toward secularity that reflects the inexorable process of modernization; other scholars reject this claim, contending both that the interrelationship between religion, secularity, and modernity in Europe is more complex and that its experience is unique in a global context. As evidence, some point to the vitality of religion in imperial Russia and the revival of religious profession and identity in Russia since the collapse of communism. This course will explore these differing perspectives on the relationship between religion, secularity, and modernity in Europe and Russia through an examination of selected topics from the Enlightenment to the present, including the interrelationship between religion on the one hand and politics, revolution, the formation of imperial and national polities and identities, social and economic change, gender, science, and the rise of consumerism on the other.",seminar,"class discussion, short response papers (1-2 pp.), and a substantial independent research project that includes a bibliographic exercise, short project statement (3-4 pp.), and final paper (17-25 pp.)","none, but some background in modern European or/and Russian history or/and religious studies is recommended",15,8-15,History majors and students with background defined above,,,may not be taken on a pass/fail basis; not available for the Gaudino option,,,Division 2,,,Writing Intensive,HIST Group C Electives - Europe and Russia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,HIST, 438,

Not surprisingly, it has had tumultuous relations with both its colonial occupier, France, and its most powerful neighbor, the United States.  From isolation and sanctions, to occupation and U.S. supported dictatorship, this seminar traces the historical silencing suffered by Haiti at the hands of western historians, the vivid images Haitians evoke in the American imagination--from boat people and carriers of Aids, to practitioners of voodoo and creators of a uniquely African-Caribbean art--and the role of the French and American governments in the recent coup against President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

How fruitful and appropriate are comparative analyses with other racial/ethnic groups, such as African Americans or European immigrants? Along the way, we explore the emergence of Latina/o Studies as an interdisciplinary and comparative field of study, as well as methods used in Latino and Latina history, specifically oral histories, government documents, newspapers, and interdisciplinary approaches.

Though war had come to Europe as early as 1939, when Germany invaded Poland, after 1941 the war became a truly global conflict of unprecedented extent, ferocity, and destructiveness. As late as 1943 it still appeared that the Axis powers might win the war. But, by the end of the 1945, the bombed-out ruins of Germany and Japan were occupied by the Allies, who were preparing to put the surviving Axis leaders and generals on trial for war crimes.
This tutorial will concentrate on a number of important questions and issues which arise from a study of World War II. What were the origins of this central event of the twentieth century? How and why did the war begin? Why did the war take the course it did? What were the most crucial or decisive episodes or events? How did the Allies win? Why did the Axis lose? Could the outcome have been different?
Many of the topics examined will also have to deal with important questions of human responsibility and with the moral or ethical dimensions of the war. Why did France, Britain, and the Soviet Union not stop Hitler earlier? Who was to blame for the fall of France and the Pearl Harbor fiasco? Why did the Allies adopt a policy of extensive firebombing of civilian targets? How could the Holocaust have happened? Could it have been stopped? Did the Atomic bomb have to be dropped? Were the war crime trials justified?

It is this commitment to a morally pure life that earned him the title of `Mahatma' or Great Soul in India.

The proliferation of such studies has contributed to the revival of the once moribund subfield of diplomatic history and restored it to the mainstream of the historical profession. Yet this ""cultural turn"" has not come without controversy, as some traditional diplomatic historians insist that it dilutes the subfield and discourages young scholars from engaging in necessary research on high-level diplomacy. Students will read several important ""state of the field"" essays alongside some of the most exciting contributions to this new trend and consider the following questions: What do these new works add to our understanding of U.S. history and the history of the United States in the World? What roles do ideology, culture, and identity play in the policymaking process? In what ways do these studies complement traditional diplomatic histories that privilege the study of power in the international arena and to what extent are they a separate venture all together?

Beyond historians, the complicity of segments of European societies in perpetrating those atrocities continues to raise thorny questions for postwar European nations about what their responsibilities are toward that past. This tutorial will focus on a series of questions relating to the historicization and memorialization of the extermination of European Jews. They include: Is the Holocaust unique? Is it a Jewish story or universal story? Does the Holocaust raise different issues for the historian than other historical events? How should the Holocaust be represented and what are the implications of different means of representing it? What role, if any, did European Jews play in their own destruction? Has Germany faced up to its past? Were Germans also victims of World War II? Who were the ""bystanders"" as compared to the ""perpetrators""? Were the postwar trials of perpetrators a travesty of justice? How appropriate are the different uses that Israel and the United States have made of the Holocaust? By the end of the course, students will have grappled with the ongoing controversies that have arisen among scholars, governments, and lay people about the meaning (and meaninglessness) of the Holocaust for the postwar world. In a world in which extraordinary acts of violence continue to be perpetrated and more and more nations' pasts are marked by episodes of extreme criminality and/or trauma, exploring the manner by which one such episode has been remembered, avenged, and adjudicated should prove relevant for future consideration of other societies' efforts to confront their own traumatic pasts.",tutorial; class time consists of weekly one-hour sessions with the instructor and a fellow student,every other week the student will write and present orally a 5- to 7-page paper on the assigned readings of that week,permission of instructor,10,10,History majors and Jewish Studies concentrators,,,"additional requirments on alternate weeks, the student will write a 2-page critique of the fellow student's paper; a final written exercise, a thought piece on the issues raised in the tutorial, will cap off the semester's work",may not be taken on a pass/fail basis; not available for the Gaudino option,,Division 2,,,Writing Intensive,HIST Group C Electives - Europe and Russia,JWST Core Electives,,,,,,,,,,TUT,,,,,,,,,,,,,Garbarini,Alexandra,,,,,,,,,,,HIST, 490,1131

Too often histories of actual revolutionary movements and the ideas they promulgated have followed either the self-serving narratives that the revolutionaries have laid out or the similarly limited stories composed by their opponents. This tutorial, by contrast, will delve into the complex, contingent, and at times counterintuitive history of revolutionary thought in modern Latin America. Our readings and discussions will carry us from the nineteenth century to the rise of the ""New Left"" in the last few years. Throughout the course our principle goal will be to examine the internal logic of the most influential programs of revolutionary thought as well as their relationship to circumstances external to them, both in their home regions and globally. At the same time, we will consider the human or moral promise and price of revolutionary options: did the proposed or alleged aims of revolutionary ideals justify the costs they would impose? This course will fulfill the requirements of the Exploring Diversity Initiative by comparing and analyzing divergent theorizations of history and society, as well as the contexts in which such theories emerged and to which we might or might not choose to apply them.

In brief, medicalization refers to those processes by which a myriad of previously {non}medical problems, once defined as ethical-religious, legal or social (e.g. drug and alcohol addition, shyness, obesity), are brought within the purview of medical science and redefined as medical problems, usually in terms of ""illness"" or ""disorder"". We will begin the course by attending to the history of medicalization and its consequences. Taking guidance from key theoretical works and exemplary case studies, we will arrive at an understanding of medicalization as a {technical} process, and modern medicine as a quite potent form of {social control}. We will then move from a consideration of medicalization to biomedicalization; from the management of human life to transformations of ""life itself"" by way of post-World War II technoscientific interventions aimed at ""optimizing"" the vitality of individuals, groups, and entire populations. In particular, we will consider empirical case studies of technoscientific developments that have made possible the work of optimization that defines biomedicalization: molecular biology, pharmacogenomics, biotechnologies, imaging techniques (EEG, PET, and fMRI), robotics, and transplant medicine, among others. Finally, we will attend to how processes of biomedical optimization have produced new ways of seeing, knowing, and imagining human bodies, such that biology is increasingly less representative of ""destiny"" than it is of possibility.

These two critical modes-reading the text versus performing the script-are often treated in compartmentalized fashion as separate, even incompatible activities. Our goal is to take up the challenge of bringing the two perspectives together within the framework of a single, integrated course. The teaching method is to bridge the gap between the two modes not by magically dissolving, but by actively engaging, the tensions between them. For example, no performance can include all the possible interpretations; performance decisions raise questions about what alternatives have been left out. Similarly, when all interpretive possibilities are held in imaginative suspension, the specifics of bodily movement and face-to-face interaction whose meanings emerge when enacted are lost. We propose to put the two orientations in a productive and innovative dialogue that enables students to experience the tension from both sides, to articulate the opportunities and limits of each side, and to combine their respective strengths. The mix of assignments (papers and scene work) will vary depending on whether students designate themselves as primarily scholars or actors, but some overlap will be built in to ensure that scholars gain understanding of acting and actors gain access to scholarship. All students will be expected to demonstrate versatility in traversing the full spectrum from interpretation through reading to interpretation through performance.The specific topic that will bring these theoretical issues into focus is the matter of sex and sexual identity, as illuminated through the analysis of language, psychology, and theatrical embodiment.

Throughout history, however, we may also encounter many instances of asymmetric conflict within states, colonies, and other political entities, involving combatants who are often indistinguishable from the general population and whose objectives are often unlike those of states: Peasant revolts, revolutions, wars of independence or national liberation, and other forms of resistance and civil insurgency pit the relatively weak against the power of the state and may succeed because, to use Mao's metaphor, the insurgents move among the people like fish in water. The close relationship between insurgent fighters and the supporting population makes the social structure, social values, social institutions--in short, the culture--of the society particularly relevant to understanding the nature of a given asymmetric conflict. In this course we will use theoretical and analytical concepts from anthropology, sociology, history, and political philosophy to examine asymmetric conflicts of the twentieth century and the present day. The course will be divided into three parts: in the first we will explore some of the theoretical literature on violence and warfare as well as some of the basic literature on tribal and peasant society, peasant revolts, wars of national liberation, guerilla warfare, and insurgencies. The second part of the course will be devoted to presentations prepared by small groups of students on case studies, e.g., the Hukbalahap insurgency in the Philippines, the communist revolutions of China, Cuba, and Malaysia, wars of national liberation such as those in Algeria and Vietnam, and other ongoing civil conflicts such as the Palestinian intifadah and ""ethnic cleansing"" in the Balkans.

Brazil presents itself as a multicultural racial democracy, a product of 500 years of mixture and progress. However, the tumultuous terms for daily life amidst legacies of slavery and often brutal development schemes belie prevailing rhetoric.

Today, however, news from the Former Soviet Union often sounds like a bizarrely gendered media stunt. For example, Russian president Vladimir Putin has been photographed topless while fishing on vacation in Siberia, while the feminist punk-rock collective Pussy Riot protested Putin's regime by performing in day-glo balaclavas in Russia's largest cathedral. This course examines related post-Soviet media spectacles in the attempt to understand the Western press's fascination with Russia, as well as key social trends defining the post-Soviet era. We will focus on the ways in which gender and sexuality have come to mark post-Soviet culture and discourse as different from those in the West. In addition to Vladimir Putin and Pussy Riot, we will consider the so-called crisis of masculinity in post-Soviet Russia, the trafficking of women from the Former Soviet Union, the revival of indigenous practices such as bride kidnapping in Kyrgyzstan and Buzkashi in Tajikistan, the Ukrainian feminist collective Femen, the Eurovision Song Context, and the 2013 legislation in the Russian Federation banning homosexual propaganda among minors. We will try to understand how concepts, such as feminism, tolerance of sexual minorities, and performed gender, have been deemed dangerous in the post-Soviet East at the very time they have attained normative status in the West.

Yet these beliefs and practices aren't in fact old-fashioned or lawless, and many of them result from South Asia's unique historical position as a former British colony. In this class, we will use ethnographic and historical research to examine what law and kinship can teach us about how the past shapes the present in post-colonial South Asia. In particular, we'll examine how a perspective that seriously considers law and kinship can help us better understand contemporary dilemmas in South Asia, ranging from controversy over women¿s right to inherit property, to the role of caste in contemporary democratic politics. The course is organized into three sections. First, we will discuss kinship, reading classic theories of kinship in the region, as well as critiques of those theories, and ending with a contemporary dilemma, the problem of dowry ""pressure"". Next, we learn about how family relationships were codified legally, and how laws were shaped to respond to perceived family ""traditions,"" in colonial and post-colonial South Asia. Finally, we will look at specific topics concerning law and kinship. As we do so, we will move from reading ethnographies to producing our own ethnographic observations using film, news stories and first-hand accounts as our primary materials.

The course uses the body as a lens by which to unpack South Asian discourses that link body and sexuality with nation, community, and population. In particular, it explores a South Asian sociology that links individual and social bodies in ways that occasion solidarity as well as social suffering, violence as well as communal cohesion. How do bodies come to signify the purity or prosperity of the nation or community and with what social or discursive effects? We begin by unpacking foundational theories of the body as proposed by Mauss, Foucault, Douglas, and Bourdieu in order to better understand how local discourses of the body help produce gender and other social hierarchies in South Asia. By considering how the human body can serve as a map for society and vice versa, we examine both classical discourses and modern institutional practices of the body including the temple, the monastery, the mosque, and the mendicant, as well as bodily practices such as yoga, celibacy, sex work, and new reproductive technologies.

In this seminar we will seek to turn such conventional wisdom on its head through examining the role that transnational actors have played in shaping the course of modern Chinese politics. However, the course's primary focus will not be upon the past, but rather the present.  More specifically, it will concentrate on the recent rise of a new class of Chinese transnational public intellectuals who have recently risen to prominence within the PRC.  It will also seek to identify the influence such individuals are having upon not only their fields of expertise, but also upon broader Chinese debates about collective identity and the country's place in a rapidly changing international system. Coming to terms with such issues will provide those who enroll in the seminar with a deeper, more nuanced, understanding of China's rise and this trend's implications for the rest of the world.

At the same time, the sheer poetic force of the story has inspired some of the greatest artistic and literary meditations in the Western tradition.

He first received the covenant and the promise of the land of Israel, but before the full revelation of the Torah to Moses. He fathers both the Jewish people and the Arabs and the significance of that wider identity was later captured both by Christianity in the work of Paul and in the Qur'an where Muhammad identified with Abraham as the prototypical and non-sectarian monotheist prophet. This course will trace the figure of Abraham by a close and multidisciplinary reading of the Jewish, Pagan, Christian and Muslim sources on Abraham. Our task is not to decide on the historicity of Abraham, but rather to explore the history of the figure and his continuing relevance for today in understanding Jewish/Christian/Muslim conflict and cooperation. We will begin with an intensive reading of the Genesis material on Abraham (12-25), where the issues of idolatry and monotheism, the covenant and circumcision, relations of the patriarch to his women and sons, and primal model of faith all are articulated. We will then turn to later Jewish developments in the figure of Abraham in midrash and apocalypse. We will then explore the view of Abraham in the classical world, the uses made of Abraham by Christianity as it broke from an emerging Rabbinic Judaism and the development of Abraham's specific connection with the view of the afterlife. We will then treat the figure of Abraham in the Qur'an and later Islamic traditions. We will conclude with an examination of the cult surrounding Abraham in the city of Hebron, a currently contested site on the West Bank where we will consider the current religious practice regarding Abraham by both Jews and Muslims.

Amidst bourgeoning national self-consciousness throughout the continent, despite the liberatory promises of the Enlightenment, Jews remained a vulnerable, segregated, and stigmatized minority population. Jews had to decide where to pin their hopes. Should they ally themselves with the liberals or the communists? Should they embrace nationalism or cosmopolitanism? Should they, perhaps, abandon Europe altogether and re-constitute themselves  elsewhere? If so, should they focus their efforts on relocation to the historical land of Israel? Or could they go anywhere? Wherever they might go, should they aspire to build a modern Jewish nation-state, a semi-autonomous Jewish community, or some other arrangement? Should this coincide with the cultivation of a distinctively Jewish modern language? If so, should it be Hebrew or Yiddish? In this course we will assess various answers to these questions proffered by Jewish political thinkers in the modern period. We will pay particular attention to the construction of ""Jews"" and ""Judaism"" in these arguments. And we will ask persistently: what constitutes a ""Jewish justification"" for a political claim in modern Jewish political theory? Coverage will include: Jewish liberalism, political Zionism, Yiddishist autonomism, messianic quietism, and other views.

In between, the course will explore colonial leaders like John Winthrop, the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony; African American leaders like Gabriel Prosser, who led a slave rebellion, and Richard Allen, a free black abolitionist; presidents like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson; First ladies like Abigail Adams and Dolley Madison; advocates for women's rights like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B.

In this course, we will look at how new ideas, social movements, and technological changes have reshaped American democracy. We will examine how founders such as Benjamin Franklin and James Madison envisioned the relation between the people and the government; how workers, African Americans, and women fought to participate in American politics; and the ways in which new technologies such as Facebook and Twitter are reshaping democratic participation in the 21st century.  We will ask: Who, exactly, has been permitted to participate in American politics, and on what terms?

A common assumption is that those who do it well--whether in the presidency, the parties, social movements, organizations, or local communities--are just and legitimate agents of democratic change, and those most celebrated are those who have helped the country make progress toward its ideals. Yet to rest on this is too simple as it is, in part, an artifact of historical construction. Assessing leadership in the moment is complicated because leaders press against the bounds of political convention--as do ideologues, malcontents, and lunatics. Indeed, a central concern of the founders was that democracy would invite demagogues who would bring the nation to ruin. Complicating things further, the nature of democratic competition is such that those vying for power have incentive to portray the opposition's leadership as dangerous. How do we distinguish desirable leadership from dangerous leadership? Can they be the same thing? Many who today are recognized as great leaders were, in their historical moment, branded dangerous. Others, whose ambitions and initiatives arguably undermined progress toward American ideals, were not recognized as dangerous at the time. In this tutorial, we will explore the concept of dangerous leadership in American history, from inside as well as outside of government. What constitutes dangerous leadership, and what makes a leader dangerous? Is it the person or the context? Who decides? How do we distinguish truly dangerous leadership from the perception of dangerous leadership? Does dangerous describe the means or the ends of leadership? Does it matter? Is leadership that privileges desirable ends, such as justice or security, at the expense of democratic means acceptable?

How much do we attribute the shaping of politics to the agency of the individual in the office and to what extent are politics the result of structural, cultural, and institutional factors? Are the politics of the presidency different in foreign and domestic policy? How are national security concerns balanced with domestic priorities such as the protection of civil liberties? How is the office and purpose of the presidency affected by an economic order predicated on private capital? Exploration of these questions will lead us to examine topics such as presidential selection, the bases of presidential power, character and leadership issues, congressional-executive relations, the media, and emergency powers.

It follows that political leadership---whether exercised by elected officials or community activists---represents a vital instrument by which people may attempt to shape the social processes that structure their communities and their everyday lives.  Seldom have American communities had greater need for creative and effective leadership than did American cities following the Second World War---yet seldom has  this kind of leadership proven more difficult to realize.  In the postwar years, cities, the drivers of the nation's phenomenal economic growth for nearly a century, confronted a host of new challenges: declining private investment; the out-migration of their middle and upper classes and, consequently, a new position as sites of concentrated poverty; persistent fiscal crises; seemingly endless ethno-racial conflict; and the rise of new epidemics---drug use, AIDS, and mass incarceration.  By the mid-1960s, these challenges had come together in the public discourse to signify a general ""urban crisis.""  This course will introduce students to the processes that have shaped American urban life since the Second World War (some of which, we will see, were in fact far from ""automatic"").  We will also examine how public officials and community leaders tried to intervene to shape those processes, what resources they could muster for doing so, and what came of their efforts---so as better to understand the possibilities and the limits of leadership in hard times.  What kinds of leadership are possible when a zero-sum logic obtains, when social ""problems"" prove ""insoluble,"" when ""positive"" action appears impossible?

After examining general models of change and of leadership, we will consider specific case studies, such as civil rights for African-Americans, gender equality, labor demands, and social conservatism. We will consider some of the complicated legacies of change. Finally, we will look at arguments that America has been ""exceptional""--or, unlike other countries--as well as critiques of these arguments, to help us gain an understanding of future prospects for political transformation.",research seminar,"several short essays, weekly writing assignments, and a longer research paper with presentation",previous course in American politics or American history,14,14,Political Science majors and Leadership Studies concentrators,,,may not be taken on a pass/fail basis,,,Division 2,,,Writing Intensive,LEAD Facets or Domains of Leadership,POEC U.S. Political Economy + Public Policy Course,PSCI American Politics Courses,PSCI Research Courses,,,,,,,01,SEM,MR,02:35,03:50,Hollander 258,,,,,,,,,Mellow,Nicole,,,,,,,,,,,LEAD, 314,1151

To address these questions, we will study portrayals of four of the most famous leaders in American history---Abraham Lincoln, Eleanor Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King, Jr.  As we explore how portrayals of these leaders have changed over time, we will ask: How have our conceptions of leadership, and the qualities effective leaders possess, evolved?  In what ways do leaders serve as symbols in historical memory for the times in which they lived and acted?  Might assessments of these leaders reveal as much about the times in which they were produced as about the leaders' own historical moments?  In what ways is the concept of ""leadership"" itself a historical construction?  Our sources will include literature, film, and journalism as well as biography and history.

But placing leaders in their much less easily encapsulated political, social, and religious contexts reveals them to be far more complicated and challenging subjects.

To what extent did the prevailing systems determine the nature of transformative as well as of normative leadership? How did various political and social norms contribute to legitimating particular kinds of leader?

For its part, leadership studies treats biography as a fundamental mode of analysis; yet the genre is problematic, for its conventions sometimes obscure the social/structural contexts within which leadership is practiced.  In this course, we will view American history through the lens of biography, asking what this genre reveals about the past as well as what it conceals.  We will also conduct critical inquiries into the relationship between historical analysis and biography and the practice of writing history through biography. What tensions exist between history and biography, and how have writers sought to negotiate these tensions?  What have historians sought to use the biographical form to do, and how successful have they been in achieving their objectives?  What do biographers' choices---their narrative emphases as well as their choices of subject---reveal about their conceptions of history?  How has the writing of analytical biography changed over time?  How have its practitioners sought to innovate, and toward what ends?

Ocean currents redistribute heat and water vapor around the globe, controlling temperature and precipitation patterns. Marine phytoplankton blooms and air-sea gas exchange modulate the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. The dynamic interaction of the atmosphere and the sea surface results in multi-year climate variations such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. This course will examine gradual and abrupt climate shifts from Earth's history and the ocean's role in driving, amplifying or dampening the changes, the ocean's response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, and the projected impacts of continued emissions and climate change on the ocean in the coming decades and millennia. We will analyze articles from the scientific literature that lay out the theory on the ocean's influence on climate, reconstruct past climate and ocean changes, test the mechanisms responsible for those changes, and with that knowledge, project the consequences of continued anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Topics may include the climate effects of opening and closing seaways with plate tectonics, ocean feedbacks that amplify the intensity of ice ages, the instability of ocean circulation during ice-sheet retreat, the evolution of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation with changing carbon dioxide through the geologic past and the next century, ocean heat and carbon dioxide uptake during the last century and into the future, and the impact on sea level, seafloor methane reservoirs, ocean acidification, oxygenation and marine ecosystems.",tutorial,each student will write five 5-page position papers; evaluation based on the critical analysis of reading from the scientific literature through writing and discussion,"GEOS 104, GEOS 210 or permission of instructor",10,10,sophomores and juniors,,,may not be taken on a pass/fail basis,,,Division 3,,,Writing Intensive,ENVI Natural World Electives,ENVS Group EB-B Electives,ENVS Group EG-B Electives,GEOS Environmental Geosciences Courses,GEOS Earth Surface Processes + Life Courses,MAST Interdepartmental Electives,,,,,T1,TUT,M,08:00,08:50,,,,,,,,,,Cook,Mea,,,,,,,,,,,MAST, 226,1153

We are forced to develop techniques to approximate not just solutions, but even the statement of the problem. Additionally, we often need the solutions quickly. Operations Research, which was born as a discipline during the tumultuous events of World War II, deals with efficiently finding optimal solutions. In this course we build analytic and programming techniques to efficiently tackle many problems. We will review many algorithms from earlier in your mathematical or CS career, with special attention now given to analyzing their run-time and seeing how they can be improved; students will be implementing many of these algorithms on computer systems of their choice.

Opera's position in European cultural history will be a primary focus of our inquiry. We will also study the intriguing relationship between text and music, aspects of performance and production, and the artistic and social conventions of the operatic world. The multidimensional nature of opera invites a variety of analytical and critical perspectives, including those of music analysis, literary studies, feminist interpretations, and political and sociological approaches.

John Williams, James Horner, Howard Shore, and Carter Burwell are as well known as Stravinsky, Holst, Shostakovich, and Strauss. The only symphony orchestra many people hear today is the one at the movies and when people do attend concerts, the music often reminds them of film scores. The way we perceive cinematic narrative is highly dependent upon the way the composer scores it. We may not always be conscious of the composer's craft, but we almost always know how we are supposed to feel or think about what is going on in a film because of the powerful musical cues. How did this language of film music evolve and where did many of the iconic musical gestures come from? These questions will be explored along with specific techniques film composers have used over the years to manipulate our perception of the visual narrative. We will look at and listen to films from different periods, observe which techniques evolved, which have changed very little, and consider when an idea is borrowed and when it might actually be new.",lecture,"assignments, midterm, final.

These are the three most beautiful things this culture's ever created.""-- (Gerald Early) Jazz is the most common name for a great African American Art form that still defies definition.  Over the past century this elastic tradition has laid down firm roots for numerous other American and World musics, while itself in the throes of a seemingly permanent identity crisis. Jazz is perennially declared dead or dying yet consistently summoned by advertisers to lend vitality and sex appeal to liquor or automobiles.  By any name and regardless of its health status, jazz has a rich  history of conservative innovators, at once restless and reverent, who made fascinating leaps of creativity out of inspiration or necessity.  This ""listening intensive"" class will look at the past century of jazz music through  20 ideas, ""what-if"" questions or movements that changed the way the music was created, presented and perceived.  Both musical concepts (such as syncopation and cross instrumental-influence) and cultural connections (jazz as cold war propaganda, jazz as protest music) will be examined, giving us freedom to link similar kinds of musical thought across disparate settings and decades.

Seeking either to realize Wagner's ""total work of art"" in the theater, or to uncover the more general correspondences celebrated by Baudelaire, modernists consistently looked beyond their own media. Collaborations on works of ""total theater"" were common: Satie, Cocteau, Massine, Picasso; Brecht, Hindemith, Weill; Stravinsky, Nijinsky, Bakst; Claudel, Honegger, Rubinstein. Modernists explored new connections between music and color (Scriabin, Kandinsky), music and literature (Joyce, Mann), and music and dance (Duncan, Graham). Occasionally, modernists attempted to unite the arts on their own: Schoenberg painted, Pound composed, and Kokoschka wrote. Our focus will be on those works of music, art, dance, and literature that explored new relationships between the arts. One goal will be to investigate whether specific equivalents exist between techniques of modernist painting, poetics, choreography, and composition. Aware of the risks and rewards of interdisciplinary study, we will attempt our own theories of artistic synthesis.

The practitioners of this new sub-genre were seen not as showmen or entertainers, but (in the words of poet Ralph Ellison) as ""frozen faced introverts, dedicated to chaos.""  This class will survey the life and music of that decade's most pivotal figure, the brilliant alto saxophonist Charlie ""Yardbird"" Parker (1920-1955).  The ubiquitous graffiti slogan ""Bird Lives"" that heralded his untimely death still rings true today, as his influence remains undimmed. In recent decades his music has become a cornerstone of jazz pedagogy, and increasingly is considered to represent more of an evolution than a revolution in jazz history. 	We will focus on Parker's musical development, with a particular emphasis on his study and musical apprenticeships with some of the major soloists of the swing era.   Through score study, guided listening and composition assignments, the class will examine and practice applications of Parker's melodic, harmonic and rhythmic innovations.  We will evaluate, compare and contrast  examples of contemporary theoretical scholarship concerning his improvisational vocabulary.  Parker's broader cultural significance and the intersections between his music and parallel artistic, social and political movements will also be addressed.  While our focus will be on Charlie Parker, the class will also discuss the contributions made to modern jazz by his most prominent collaborators, including Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, and Bud Powell.  Additionally, we will consider his influence on subsequent generations of musicians by investigating personal anecdotes as well as the work of several ""first generation disciples,"" such as Cannonball Adderley, Jackie McLean and Ornette Coleman.

We will ask how these and other musical women active in both the sacred and the secular spheres (such as the nun Birgitta of Sweden, and Queen Blanche of Castile) negotiated their places and made their voices heard within the patriarchal society of their time.

Their divergent approaches to the genre provoked heated debate that continues today. Both composers not only transformed the operatic forms they inherited, but they also had a significant impact on the cultural and political histories of their emerging nations. Throughout the semester we will juxtapose major works by these composers in order to investigate such topics as opera's relationship to its literary sources; the staging of opera; intersections between opera and film; connections between opera and political context; and biographical influences on the creation of opera. Our final meeting will be devoted to the broader operatic and cultural legacies of these two composers.

1,Music,MUS,018700,1,Spring 2015,,MUS, 272,Music and Meaning,,,(W),,,"Nearly everyone finds music meaningful, but what exactly does it mean? Without the help of words, this largely non-referential art presents special challenges to interpretation. While most would agree that musical sounds can do such things as mimic the rumbling of thunder, evoke the countryside, suggest the act of chasing, or express rage, the capacity of music to convey meaning remains controversial among scholars, performers, and listeners. Some, following music critic Eduard Hanslick, assert that musical works are essentially ""tonally moving forms""--patterns of sound with no reference to the world outside themselves; a work's meaning derives solely from the interplay of musical elements. Others counter that music can signify aspects of human experience, its sounds and structures not merely referring to the outside world but even relating complex narratives. Certain writers have argued that, without the assistance of language, what music signifies remains vague, while others insist that the meaning of music is actually more precise than that of words. In this tutorial course, we will explore a range of questions regarding musical meaning. How can combinations of pitches, rhythms, and instrumental timbres signify something beyond themselves? Is the subject of musical meaning more relevant to some historical styles or genres than others? How can we glean the meaning(s) of a work? Should we concentrate on formal processes within the music? Consider socially constructed meanings? Seek the composer's intentions? What makes some interpretations more convincing than others? In grappling with these questions, students will engage with writings by Agawu, Cone, Hanslick, Kramer, Langer, Lewin, Newcomb, and Schopenhauer, among others. Music to be studied includes works by Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin, Brahms, Mahler, Tchaikovsky, Ravel, Stravinsky, Glass, and Adams.","tutorial; during the first and last weeks of the semester, students will attend two group classes; in the other weeks, students will meet with the instructor in pairs for a one-hour session at a mutually convenient time","students will write and present a 5- to 6-page paper every other week and a 1-2 page response to their partner's paper in the alternate weeks; evaluation will be based on five papers/presentations, and five responses","ability to read music, or permission of instructor",10,10,sophomores and juniors,MUS Group A Electives--classes 2015 and 2016,,may not be taken on a pass/fail basis,,,Division 1,,,Writing Intensive,MUS Group A Electives,,,,,,,,,,T1,TUT,TR,08:30,09:45,,,,,,,,,,Hirsch,Marjorie,,,,,,,,,,,MUS, 272,1153

How could mere sounds represent a threat? Yet precisely because its meanings can be obscure, enabling it to achieve its ends surreptitiously, music has intertwined with danger throughout history. With its power to stir the emotions, stimulate bodily movement, encode messages, and foment rebellion, music has often been perceived as an agent of harm. Plato claimed that too much music could make a man effeminate or neurotic, and warned that certain musical modes, melodies, and rhythms promote licentious behavior and anarchic societies. Puritans, Victorians, and Totalitarians, as well as opponents of ragtime, rock 'n roll, and rap, have also accused certain musical genres or styles of exerting dangerous influences, and sought to limit or suppress them. In Afghanistan, the Taliban banned music altogether. While music has often been unfairly accused, its potential for placing people in actual danger is undeniable. Works that are played at ear-splitting decibel levels, that call upon performers to injure themselves, that are used as a form of psychological torture, or that incite violence demand reconsideration of the widely shared view that music is fundamentally a form of entertainment.",tutorial,"evaluation will be based on participation, five 5- to 6-page papers/presentations, and five 1- to 2-page responses",an ability to read music is desirable but not required,10,10,sophomores and juniors,MUS Group A Electives--classes 2015 and 2016,,may not be taken on a pass/fail basis; not available for the Gaudino option,,,Division 1,,,Writing Intensive,MUS Group A Electives,,,,,,,,,,,TUT,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hirsch,Marjorie,,,,,,,,,,,MUS, 273,1133

We will observe the often amazing ways composers of texted music use the tonal system to create musical desires--desires that may be fulfilled, withheld, delayed, redirected, and so forth, in ways that enhance, or enact the desires of characters in a drama or poem. In addition to the specific issues involving texted and dramatic works, the course will introduce certain techniques and insights of linear analysis--one of the most profound developments in tonal analysis during the last century.

Our work in this seminar will involve readings in music theory and history, ethnomusicology, and cognitive studies as well as in the emerging field of sound studies as we attempt to define timbre, explore its manifestations in a wide variety of music, and develop an analytical approach and descriptive vocabulary tooled specifically to this musical element. We will consider how composers and performers of both art and popular musics have wielded timbre as an expressive device and how technology may allow us to analyze details of timbral performance and perception. We will investigate the relationship between timbre and orchestration, from the rise of Haydn's orchestra to the Klangfarbenmelodie of Schoenberg. We will consider extremes of timbral distortion in both vocal and electric guitar effects in rock music as well in such traditions as Korean p'ansori and will explore various forms of speech music and the work of composers of spectral music to expand our case studies.

We doubt, we point out that no one can be certain in what she believes, and we are suspicious of declarations of transcendent reason or truth (unless they are our own). Emboldened by our confidence in skeptical arguments, we claim that knowledge is inevitably limited, that it depends on one's perspective, and that everything one believes is relative to context or culture. No domain of inquiry is immune to this destructive skepticism and confident relativism. Science is only ""true"" for some people, agnosticism is the only alternative to foolish superstition, and moral relativism and, consequently, nihilism are obvious. But is the best conclusion we can come to with respect to our intellectual endeavors that skepticism always carries the day and that nothing at all is true? In this tutorial, we will investigate the nature of skepticism and the varieties of relativism it encourages. Our readings will come primarily from philosophy, but will be supplemented with material from anthropology, physics, psychology, and linguistics. We will look at relativism with respect to reason and truth in general as well as with respect to science, religion, and morality. Along the way, we will need to come to grips with the following surprising fact. With few exceptions, thoroughgoing skepticism and relativism have not been the prevailing views of the greatest minds in the history of philosophy. Were they simply too unsophisticated and confused to understand what is for us the irresistible power of skepticism and relativism? Or might it be that our skepticism and relativism are the result of our own laziness and failure?

1,Philosophy,PHIL,011829,1,Fall 2014,,PHIL, 115,Personal Identity,,,(W),,,"Through lectures, discussions, close readings and assigned writings, we will consider some of the variety of philosophical questions about the nature of persons, and personal identity through time. Persons are subjects of experiences, have thoughts and feelings, motivation and agency; a person is thought of as continuous over time, and as related to, recognized and respected by other persons. Thus, the concept of person plays a significant role in most branches of philosophy: metaphysics, epistemology, moral and political philosophy, and of course in the philosophy of mind. Conceptions of the person are equally important for scientific research programs (especially in psychology), for Law, and for the arts (especially mimetic arts). Questions about persons are thus of central importance for a myriad of our theories and practices, and for the ways in which we live our lives. The aim of this course is to explore and evaluate a number of rival conceptions of persons and personal identity over time. Some of the questions which we will discuss are: What is a person? How do I know that I am one? What constitutes my knowledge of myself as a person, and does that knowledge differ in any significant respect from my knowledge of physical objects and other people? What makes me the particular person that I am, and how is my identity as this individual person preserved over time?

We will examine the wager in its original home of Pascal's Pensees, and look at William James' related article, ""The Will to Believe"". The millennia old problem of whether human suffering is compatible with God's perfection is called ""the problem of evil"".

Should the fact of such disagreement lead us to conclude that truth, goodness, and beauty are in some basic sense relative to human beings, perhaps as individuals, perhaps as members of societies or cultures?

Why then should we spend our time studying people who in addition to having these surprising beliefs have been dead for 2500 years? First of all, Greek thinkers, especially Plato and Aristotle, radically shaped the trajectory of western thought in every area of philosophy. No one can have an adequate understanding of western intellectual history without some familiarity with the Greeks, and we might think that an understanding of our intellectual history can deepen our understanding of our own situation.

Loyalty is frequently expected by family, friends and lovers, and demanded by institutions, religious and political communities, as well as by the state. A person incapable of loyalty is often characterized as fickle, cold, self-serving and sometimes even pathological. However, the status of loyalty as a virtue has always been suspect: it has been argued that it is incompatible with impartiality, fairness and equality, and claimed that it is always exclusionary. So, some relationships with other people--such as friendships, familial ties, love, patriotism--seem to be ethically desirable, central to the quality of our lives, and yet prima facie in tension with the widely held belief that morality requires impartiality and equal treatment of all human beings. Are we ever justified in having more concern, and doing more, for our friends, family, community or nation?

If so then freedom may seem impossible, for we are all deeply influenced by external factors ranging from the general laws of nature to specific features of our genetic endowment and social environment including religion, political ideology, and advertising. These affect not only our particular choices but also, more fundamentally, who we are and what we value. Since it is undeniable that we are pervasively influenced by such forces, the real question is whether, and how, free choice is possible amidst all of these influences. In this course we will examine the best-known recent philosophical attempts to make sense of the nature of free will and responsibility. Since these issues have a direct bearing on which theory of legal punishment we should accept, we will also examine influential theories of punishment. Our focus will be on works by contemporary authors.

We will examine these (and other questions) in the context of the great philosophical revolution at the beginning of the last century: the linguistic turn and the birth of analytic philosophy.

While you're debating whether to take this class, consider the following puzzle. There is a village where the barber shaves (a) all those and (b) only those who do not shave themselves. Now, ask yourself: who shaves the barber? You will see that if the barber does not shave himself, then by condition (a) he does shave himself. And, if the barber does shave himself, then by condition (b) he does not shave himself. Thus, the barber shaves himself if and only if he does not shave himself.

We begin by examining some of the central concepts of Buddhist psychology, its treatment of the mind as a selfless stream of consciousness, its examination of the variety of mental factors and its accounts of the relation between cognition and affects. We also introduce the practice of meditation as a way to observe the mind and raise questions concerning the place of its study in the mind-sciences. We pursue this reflection by examining the views of James, Husserl, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, particularly as they concern the methods for the study of the mind and the relation between consciousness, reflexivity and the body. In this way, we develop a rich array of analytical tools and observational practices to further our understanding of the mind. But we also question the value of these tools based on first person approaches by relating them to the third person studies of the mind. In this way, we come to appreciate the importance of considering the biology on which mental processes are based and the light that this approach throws on the nature of consciousness. We conclude by considering the relation between first and third person studies of the mind, focusing on the concept of the embodied mind as a fruitful bridge between these different traditions.",seminar,"regular practice of meditation, a class presentation, a short essay (6-pages); a long final research paper (15 pages)","some background in either Psychology, Cognitive Sciences, Philosophy or permission of instructor",18,18,Religion and Philosophy majors,,,,,,Division 2,,,,COGS Interdepartmental Electives,PHIL Contemp Metaphysics & Epistemology Courses,REL Contemporary Critical Inquiry Courses,,,,,,,,,SEM,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dreyfus,Georges,,,,,,,,,,,PHIL, 288,1141

Apparently he corrupted the youth by engaging with them in philosophy. In this class, we will attempt to carry on the noble tradition of corruption by philosophy. We will read works by three of Socrates' contemporaries: Aristophanes, Xenophon, and especially Plato. Through an examination of these works, we will try to get some feeling for what Socrates' controversial positions and his arguments for these positions may have been. While he never wrote any philosophical works of his own, Socrates is one of the most influential thinkers in the western tradition. His thought influenced the thought of subsequent generations of philosophers. In fact, Socrates seems to have been thought of as a kind of intellectual saint in the Hellenistic world. The stoics and skeptics both claimed a Socratic imprimatur for their own thought. Stoicism and skepticism, however, are wildly divergent schools of thought. How could proponents of each be claiming to follow in the footsteps of Socrates? We will read some representative works from each of these schools of thought to see how each approaches Socrates.

It is not enough for it merely to be <I>about</I> a character who happens to be a philosopher; nor is it just that philosophical positions are reviewed in the narrative, as in Gaarder's <I>Sophie's World</I>. Milan Kundera tried to answer this question by saying that a good philosophical novel does not serve philosophy but, on the contrary, tries to ""get hold of a domain that (...) philosophy had kept for itself. There are metaphysical problems, problems of human existence, that philosophy has never known how to grasp in all their concreteness and that only the novel can seize."" If Kundera is right, fictional narratives (such as novels) sometimes do the philosophical work that philosophy cannot do for itself. What kind of work is that, and how is it accomplished? Why can't argumentative prose--philosophers' preferred form of expression--clearly <I>say</I>, and moreover <I>prove</I>, what literature, theatre and film illustrate, show and display? One possible answer which we will examine is that, while many philosophers recognize that there are intimate connections between what we believe, feel and do, philosophical argumentation by its very nature appeals to belief alone; narrative art, by contrast, can simultaneously engage our reason, emotions, imagination and will, thus resulting not only in deepening our understanding, but also in transformation of the self. <BR>

However, this approach is too narrow, since people use language to do a myriad of things: to ask, demand, promise, praise, blame, threaten, command, insinuate, evoke, express feelings, and sometimes just to play. The philosophical study of what we do in language, and how we understand one another, is called pragmatics; within the analytic tradition, the main philosophical contributions to the study of pragmatics in language came from Peirce, Wittgenstein, Austen, Grice and Searle. Other philosophers and literary theorists have used some of their ideas recently to throw light on the nature of textual meaning and the interpretation of literary texts. We shall first explore the salient features of the pragmatic approaches to language, paying special attention to Austin's notion of illocutionary force and Grice's notion of non-natural meaning. We will then examine how these notions may be exploited in the consideration of various long-standing issues in the theory of literary interpretation. We will discuss the importance of specific genre conventions and broader contextual matters to the interpretation of literary texts (along the lines suggested by Quentin Skinner); the possibility of using intention to rule out mistaken and arrive at acceptable interpretations, if not a single correct interpretation (a possibility denied by such relativists as Stanley Fish); the use and meaning of metaphors; and the host of questions surrounding the intentional fallacy (the alleged result of invoking authorial intention to determine textual meaning).

Unfortunately, the relevance of Hume's ideas and arguments for particular philosophical disciplines has too often led to a piece-meal reading of his work: the three books of <I>Treatise</I> (""Of the Understanding,"" ""Of the Passions"" and ""Of Morals"") are typically considered in isolation from one another. Epistemologists don't seem to think that Hume's account of human psychology, morality and taste can in any way illuminate his treatment of skepticism and natural belief, while moral philosophers often neglect Hume's conclusions about the limits of our knowledge in analyzing his conception of motivation, action, obligation and virtue. In contrast with this interpretive tendency, this tutorial will focus on Hume's"" science of human nature""--his overall philosophical project in <I>Treatise</I>--and cultivate the discussion of different philosophical issues and arguments in light of this general aim of the work as a whole.
We will start by situating Hume's project within the historical tradition in which he thought and against which <I>Treatise</I> was directed.

His depiction of the trial and death of Socrates is one of the classics of western literature, and his views on ethics and politics continue to occupy a central place in our discussions 2400 years after they were written. It is, in fact, quite difficult to get through any course of study in the liberal arts without some familiarity with Plato. Nevertheless, comparatively few people realize that the views we commonly think of as ""Platonic"" represent only one strand in Plato's thought. For example, we commonly attribute to Plato a theory of the Forms on the basis of his claims in the so-called ""middle dialogues"" (mainly Republic, Phaedo, and Symposium). However, in his philosophically more sophisticated and notoriously difficult later dialogues (such as the Parmenides, Philebus, Sophist and Statesman), Plato engages in radical criticism and revision of his earlier views. In this course, we will spend the first third of the semester attempting to understand the metaphysics and epistemology in Plato's middle dialogues. We will spend the balance of the semester coming to grips with Plato's arguments in the later dialogues. We will read several complete dialogues in translation, and will also read a wide variety of secondary source material.

In this course, we will study the literature in contemporary philosophy on the nature of knowledge and rational belief. Epistemologists seek answers to the following kinds of questions: When is it rational to have a particular belief? What is knowledge (as opposed to mere opinion)? In order to be justified in holding a belief, must someone know (or believe) that she is justified in holding that belief? What, if anything, justifies our scientific knowledge? These questions are typically asked within a framework where the overarching goal is attaining truth and avoiding falsity. Beyond this common ground, however, epistemologists are much divided. Some maintain that these issues are solely the provinces of philosophy, using traditional a priori methods. Others maintain that these questions will only yield to methods that incorporate our broader insight into the nature of the world including, perhaps, feminist thought or science. Both stances face severe difficulties. Further, even where there is agreement as to the proper way of answering epistemological questions, there is a stunning variety of possible answers to each question.",tutorial,each student will write a 5- to 6-page paper every other week (6 in all) and comment on his or her tutorial partner's paper in alternate weeks,at least one upper-level PHIL course or permission of the instructor,10,6,current and prospective Philosophy majors,,,may not be taken on a pass/fail basis,,,Division 2,,,Writing Intensive,COGS Interdepartmental Electives,PHIL Contemp Metaphysics & Epistemology Courses,TEAC Related Courses,,,,,,,,,TUT,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cruz,Joseph,,,,,,,,,,,PHIL, 331,1131

Consequently, many philosophers deeply influenced by pragmatism do not recognize the fact, while, on the other hand, some self-proclaimed pragmatists of our days can hardly be seen as continuing the tradition to which they pledge allegiance. This seminar will try to establish, with as much accuracy as the subject allows, what are the central tenets of American Pragmatism, how they have shaped contemporary epistemology and the philosophy of science, and finally, to what extent are pragmatist approaches to human knowledge philosophically sound and fruitful.
The seminar will fall into two unequal parts. The first, shorter part will focus on the writings of the three classics of American pragmatism--Charles S. Peirce, William James and John Dewey--and analyze their reaction against traditional epistemology, as well as the positive philosophical ideas that they had to offer. The second, longer part of the seminar will try to isolate and follow some of the pragmatist currents which run through epistemology and philosophy of science in the 20th and 21st centuries.

We will pay special attention to the structure of arguments for and against relativism, as well as to the moral motivations and perceived consequences of its endorsement or rejection. We will thus be led to discuss some of the concepts common to epistemology, metaphysics and ethics: reason, justification, objectivity, understanding, reality and truth. Some of the questions we will consider are: Are moral standards relative to cultural frameworks? Are there incompatible but equally true ways of describing the world? Is rationality--the notion of a good reason to believe something--relative to cultural norms? Is relativism a form of skepticism? Is it forced on people who endorse cultural pluralism as their political ideal as the only tenable philosophical position.

We will conclude the semester by touching upon recent developments in cosmology, where observations have led to dramatic surprises about the make-up of our universe, and particle physics, where the Large Hadron Collider experiment is poised to extend our understanding of nature to higher energies and shorter distances.

The country's politics have always been keyed, in important ways, to geography: representation in national government is defined in terms of geographic areas; resources from the national government are distributed unequally around the country; state and local governments, which have an influential role in our political system, vary tremendously from one place to the next; and the country's history has been marked by the violence of geographic conflicts as well as the acquisition of new territory. Much of its social and economic life can also be understood in terms of geography. Patterns of settlement, immigration, slavery, agriculture, education, religion, and cultural production have left and continue to leave different patterns of sediment throughout the country; these patterns and their interactions form the bedrock of American politics.

International politics differs from domestic politics in the absence of centralized, legitimate institutions. Anarchy characterizes the world of sovereign states--there is no world government, nor agreement that one is desirable or even possible. This lack of a common authority means that any dispute among countries is up to the countries themselves to settle, by negotiating, appealing to shared norms, or using force. For this reason, while international relations involves many of the same topics that consume domestic politics--ethnic antagonisms, spending on aid, war, national identity, inequality, weapons manufacture, finance, loans, pollution, migration--it shares few of the same processes for dealing with them. This course covers the theories and problems central to international relations.

It asks, for example, where sovereign states come from, why political life differs so much from one country to another, and how political regimes, structures and institutions change, sometimes suddenly. Thus comparative politics is often about what citizens of countries with stable and relatively effective governments take for granted (and why they may take it for granted).
In this course, we will examine several broad historical-political themes: the rise of modern state structures; the emergence of capitalism;  the articulation of national identities; the spread of liberalism and democracy; and the roots of terrorism, and the effects of war and religion on politics. Worthwhile answers will require us to look at them theoretically, historically, comparatively, and through contemporary developments.",lecture/discussion,"(fall) five 2-page essays, a 5-page paper, and a short final; (spring)  two 5-page papers and a final exam",none,35,30,first-year students and sophomores,,,,,,Division 2,,,,POEC Required Courses,PSCI Comparative Politics Courses,,,,,,,,,01,LEC,MR,01:10,02:25,Hopkins Hall 002,,,,,,,,,Mahon,James,,,,,,,,,,,PSCI, 204,1151

A common assumption is that those who do it well--whether in the presidency, the parties, social movements, organizations, or local communities--are just and legitimate agents of democratic change, and those most celebrated are those who have helped the country make progress toward its ideals. Yet to rest on this is too simple as it is, in part, an artifact of historical construction. Assessing leadership in the moment is complicated because leaders press against the bounds of political convention--as do ideologues, malcontents, and lunatics. Indeed, a central concern of the founders was that democracy would invite demagogues who would bring the nation to ruin. Complicating things further, the nature of democratic competition is such that those vying for power have incentive to portray the opposition's leadership as dangerous. How do we distinguish desirable leadership from dangerous leadership? Can they be the same thing? Many who today are recognized as great leaders were, in their historical moment, branded dangerous. Others, whose ambitions and initiatives arguably undermined progress toward American ideals, were not recognized as dangerous at the time. In this tutorial, we will explore the concept of dangerous leadership in American history, from inside as well as outside of government. What constitutes dangerous leadership, and what makes a leader dangerous? Is it the person or the context? Who decides? How do we distinguish truly dangerous leadership from the perception of dangerous leadership? Does dangerous describe the means or the ends of leadership? Does it matter? Is leadership that privileges desirable ends, such as justice or security, at the expense of democratic means acceptable? Is democratic leadership in service of ""dangerous"" goals acceptable, and what are these goals?",tutorial,six 5-page essays; six 2-page response papers; and one final 5-page rewritten essay,none,10,10,Political Science majors and Leadership Studies concentrators,,,may not be taken on a pass/fail basis,,,Division 2,,,Writing Intensive,LEAD Facets or Domains of Leadership,,,,,,,,,,,TUT,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mellow,Nicole,,,,,,,,,,,PSCI, 206,1133

Historically, mid-term elections, elections without the dominant consideration of who will be the President, generate less attention and less involvement of the public. But, while midterm elections often seem to have less at stake, in 2014 much is at stake. The 21st century in the United States has had a very turbulent beginning and the American public is very divided over how best to respond to the many challenges that confront the United States. This course explores the factors that shape the outcome of political elections in America. Among the factors we will consider are the state of the economy, international events, the role of political parties at the state and national levels, the current partisan balance, ideology, media, special interests, money, candidates, the ""hot"" issues of the moment, of which there are many, and long enduring issues that have long generated conflict at the national level.

The accumulation of wealth has been lauded as both a worthy individual activity and a vital component of the nation's public interest. Yet inequality in wealth may conflict with the political equality necessary for democratic governance and public trust, leading to concerns that we are sacrificing community, fairness, and opportunity for the benefit of a small portion of the population. This tutorial focuses on questions about the public value of wealth and its accumulation, which have become more pressing now that the richest one percent of Americans own 34 percent of privately held wealth. Some readings will be historical, particularly those focusing on American political thought and the politics of the Gilded Age, such as Andrew Carnegie's ""Gospel of Wealth"".

The influence of public opinion on public affairs and popular governments is a relatively new phenomenon in the history of governments (largely subsequent to the American and French revolutions). We can see from recent events the impact of public opinion: In the early 1990s the American public quickly became interested in drought and starvation in Somalia pressing the American government to intervene, if briefly and unsuccessfully. Some have claimed that American journalists successfully provoked the American public to go to war (the Spanish-American War, creating the slogan, ""Remember the Maine""), and to withdraw from war (Viet Nam). More recently, public support to commence the Iraq war was generated in the United States while at the same time democratic publics in other nations strongly opposed the war. We see political leaders make use of the"" bully pulpit"" to rally support for their agendas, efforts that sometimes succeed and other times fail. We shall explore public opinion in American politics. There are many interesting questions awaiting us this semester. How do events and crises influence public opinion? Which psychological, sociological, and political factors impact public opinion formation? When and under what circumstances do pressure groups influence public opinion? Do mass beliefs alter individual voters' choices? When and how do political leaders influence public opinion and when does public opinion influence political leaders?

The course illuminates such submerged, neglected, and contested bodies of knowledge by focusing on eight concepts: justice, rights, recognition, freedom, equality, democracy, love, and judgment.  Through these principles, students are able to address how we frame questions of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, authenticity, the public sphere, incarceration, and globalization.

International law is like domestic law, with one difference: the same group that makes the law enforces it. In other respects it is the same: it protects the status quo, including the distribution of power among its members; it spells out legitimate and illegitimate ways of resolving conflicts of interest; it is biased toward the powerful; it tells its members how to act to coordinate their interests and minimize direct conflict; some of it is laughable and purely aspirational, some of it necessary for survival. And like domestic law, it is enforced only some of the time, and then against the weak more than the strong. Yet law is still where we look first for justice.

On the one hand, shifting ideas about gender have influenced the development of the sciences through history: for example, some feminists argue that science has historically been premised upon a view of women as objects, not subjects, of knowledge. On the other hand, shifting ideas about science have strongly influenced the development of feminist theory and practice: for example, debates about reproductive rights are often couched in terms of a conflict between reliable scientific knowledge of embryos, STDs, etc. and an unscientific, patriarchal worldview. Do science and technology serve to transform or reinforce power imbalances based on gender, race, and sexuality? Should feminist theory embrace objectivity and model itself upon scientific procedures of knowledge production? Or should feminists reject objectivity as a myth told by the powerful about their own knowledge-claims and develop an alternative approach to knowledge? What is ""objectivity"" anyway, and how has this norm changed through history? What kinds of alternatives to objectivity exist, and should they, too, count as ""science""?

It will engage the debate between them about the source and nature of power. What is it, and where does it come from? Is it primarily ""material"" in content or largely ""ideal""? What does each think about the origins of capitalism, and what is at stake theoretically in their respective interpretations? Second, the course will consider how Marx and Weber have influenced 20th century thinking about the relationship between capitalism and modernity. Is modernity intimately linked with capitalism, as Marx would argue, or is it separate from it, as Weber would have it? To get at this question, we will read Karl Polanyi and Barrington Moore in this section. Third, the course will address Marxist and Weberian treatments of states. What are they? Where do states come from? Do they originate in consent? In war? Are they autonomous from or captured by social forces? In this section, we will read Charles Tilly, Theda Skocpol, Alfred Stephan, and Karl Schmitter. Finally, the course will consider what comparative politics has to say about the nature and origins of collective political identities (national, ethnic, cultural).

The state cannot simply give up the socialist myth because without it the rationale for Communist Party hegemony evaporates. But China's rulers cannot avoid political reform, both ideological and institutional, because to do so heightens the legitimacy crisis born of Maoist failures.

Tourism accounts for most of the revenue that the poorest countries receive; meanwhile, presidents and prime ministers of nuclear-capable countries beg on TV for visitors. Where are the politics in this vast, complicated industry and why is no one paying attention? This class explores various types of tourism, asking what happens in a tourist encounter, who benefits, who loses, and what changes.

This course explores this conundrum by examining the American state, and its growth, in various arenas.

I sought the image of democracy itself, with its inclinations, its character, its prejudices, and its passions, in order to learn what we have to fear or hope from its progress."" What would Tocqueville see if he returned to America today, almost 200 years later? What types of institutions, dynamics, and processes animate American political life in the twenty-first century? With Tocqueville as a guide to thinking about political ethnography, this course investigates six central elements of political life--religion, education, civic engagement, difference, representation, and crime and punishment--that simultaneously pose problems for and represent sites of progress in American democracy. For each subject, we will ask several key questions. How has that particular aspect of political life changed in the recent past? How might it change in the near future? Does it conform to how American politics is designed to work? To how we want American politics to work? Using a diverse set of readings drawn from empirical political science, contemporary democratic theory, American political thought, historical documents, political punditry (from the left and the right), and current events, our focus, like Tocqueville before us, is on teasing out both the lived experience--the character and challenges--of American democracy and examining any disconnect between that experience and the ideals that undergird it. Among the many specific questions we will consider are the extent to which America is a religious nation, whether recent changes in higher education have affected the health of democratic politics, the effects of technology on civic engagement, and the place of the jury system in securing democratic justice. Throughout the semester, we will not only approach these questions from the joint perspectives of theory and practice but also seek to enrich our understanding by exploring American democracy as it happens all around us with several exercises in the community at large.",discussion,"two experiential projects with accompanying write-ups of at least 5 and 7 pages, six 2-3 page ethnographic reflections, and class participation",a previous course in American politics or Political Theory or permission of instructor,19,19,,,,,,,Division 2,,,,EXPE Experiential Education Courses,LEAD American Domestic Leadership,PSCI American Politics Courses,,,,,,,,,LEC,,,,,,,,,,,,,Crowe,Justin,,,,,,,,,,,PSCI, 309,1123

For example, many political philosophers begin their political programs by asserting some foundational claims about ""human nature"" which in turn led them to their justification for their vision of politics. For example, the enlightenment thinkers held that science and technology would strengthen rationality and thereby making democracy more viable. On the other hand, those who defend authoritarian regimes often do so by proclaiming that the general public is incapable of rationality and of self-rule and should therefor accept rule by their betters. Many of these arguments turn on how rational people are and on their capacity for and willingness to pursue justice for all people. We explore what psychology tells us about people as political citizens and as leaders. The course pays special attention to the powerful, but surprising, roles that emotions play in all aspects of politics. Central to politics is the general issue of judgment, and its more important variants, moral and political judgment. If we are to trust ourselves to rule ourselves, how well will we secure justice and liberty for one and all among us? Political psychology is one of the very oldest disciplines (it can be dated at least back to the early classic Greeks, among them Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle).

But there is also an American tradition of antipathy toward parties. They have been criticized by some for inflaming divisions among the people and for grid-locking the government. For others, political parties fail to offer citizens meaningful choices; the Republican and Democratic parties are likened to a choice between ""tweedledee and tweedledum.""

On one hand, the United States was founded on the principles of liberty and equality, and consequently the American ethos is largely characterized by individualism and egalitarianism. On the other hand, the U.S. has faced and continues to be challenged with matching its expectations and ideals of itself with reality, as there are on-going inequalities based on race, gender, religion, and sexuality. Nonetheless, one would have difficulty in arguing that American society has not improved at all, especially over the past half-century. The U.S. government -- via Congress, the Supreme Court, and Executive Orders of various Presidents -- has improved the well-being and status of racial minorities.  Further, the overwhelming majority of American citizens eschew racist language and attacks on racial and ethnic minorities. Some would argue that the election of the United States --  first Black president is a clear indication that the country is approaching -- if not already realizing -- its post-racial, American Dream. But, scholars who have tried to measure the significance, impact, and effect of race on American politics are currently engaged in a highly contested debate on the extent to which racism has declined in this society. In this tutorial, we will explore a variety of debates concerning the role of race in American society and American Politics. Have racial attitudes improved over the past 60 years or has the language of racial animus simply changed over that time? Are racial minorities failing to live up the opportunities provided to them by the U.S. Constitution and various other laws or are there structural barriers that are too high for them to overcome? Is the election of minority leaders in majority white districts a sign that racial attitudes have an insignificant influence on candidate evaluation and elections or have minority candidates deracialized their campaigns in a way that may ultimately disserve minority groups?

Course readings critically examine the idea of authenticity, casting it in light of philosophical debates on existence, the nature of being, the idea of the self, and the role of individual experience in generating identities and subjectivities. We will begin with Kierkegaard's account of the singularity of one's own existence and the dimensions of individuality that cannot be captured by traditional ethics and philosophical categories.

The sublime has meant different things to a great number of thinkers in the Western philosophical tradition, going back to a treatise attributed to Longinus, a 1st century Greek rhetoretician. Longinus was concerned with the power of great poets to ""elevate"" their audiences, transporting them beyond the limits of their comprehension through mixtures of terror, wonder and awe. How did this old text focusing on experiences beyond the rational come to hold such fascination for philosophers and political thinkers during the Age of Enlightenment? What is the relationship between current events in politics and public culture and the recent revival of scholarly interest in the sublime? Beyond revolution and war, course readings will explore the limits of human comprehension and apprehension in environmental politics, debates over fetal rights, and the fear of confronting people different from ourselves.

Although he was not explicitly preoccupied with articulating political principles and only rarely addressed questions of governance or policy, his assumptions, theories, and therapeutic techniques have fundamental implications for the basic questions of political theory--questions about, for instance, the sources of conflict and group cohesion, what ways of living are desirable and attainable, and the place of reason, desire, emotion, affect, and motive in the interpretation and explanation of human interaction. This tutorial offers an in-depth exploration of Freud's key writings and concepts, from his early work on sexuality and dreams through his final writings. While we will read some of the texts that most directly address conventional political topics, Freud generally has more to say to students of politics when he is formulating his fundamental views of the psyche (of the nature and role of the unconscious, of drives, etc.), and the syllabus will reflect that view. Over the course of the semester, we will consider some scholarly commentaries on specific texts as well as critical assessments of the psychoanalytic project; as time allows, we may also engage such key later psychoanalytical thinkers as Klein, Winnicott, Lacan, and Kristeva.

Treating the visual as a site of power and struggle, order and change, we will examine not only how political institutions and conflicts shape what images people see and how they make sense of them but also how the political field itself is visually constructed.

In a moment of global economic crisis, amidst continuing problems of war, violence, poverty, and injustice, this concern may seem puzzling, even fundamentally misplaced. Yet just as Plato, for instance, famously connected questions of the good and the true to those of the beautiful (so that it is anachronistic to impute to him a separation between political and aesthetic domains), some notable recent theorists claim that investigating aesthetic matters can enable us to gain a better understanding of political perceptions, ideals, aspirations, struggles, and possibilities. Among the main questions we will ask in this seminar is whether or not that claim is persuasive. Along the way, we will we will pay sustained attention to such matters as the role of emotion, affect, and the senses in political life, the nature of aesthetic judgment, its relationship to both political judgment and structures of power, and the similarities and differences between making art and acting politically.

One of the goals of the Enlightenment was to find a solution to the problem of intolerance and the violence that was and is its frequent  companion. One core expectation was that progress would result from expanding knowledge. Progress would enable reason to replace dogmatism and faith (especially fighting faiths), progress in understanding the new economics of trade and the politics of liberality would produce commonwealths, producing more cosmopolitan societies marked by justice, enduring peace and prosperity. Moreover, democracy would spread thereby integrating more nations into the democratic camp. And, the lives of the many would improve. That vision has lost its promise. The 20th century, for all its economic and technological improvements, was also witness to terrible intolerance, attacks on civilians in war, ethnic purging has continued even after the holocaust. Intolerance led to wars between states, to violence within states (such as Darfur, Sri Lanka, Bosnia to name but three). Hence, the three questions posed by this course: 1) What are the most important factors that continue to produce intolerance; 2) Are the factors that produce and strengthen justice and tolerance; and 3) What can be done to increase a society's tolerance and justice, both in the United States and abroad?

As a sensibility, it values limits, questions good intentions, and worries about grand ambitions. It takes the basic contours of human behavior as given and beyond the control of actors to alter, perhaps giving rise to a kind of passivity in response. The realist sensibility tends to doubt the efficacy of human action, to believe that attempts to improve the terms of human interaction not only are doomed to fail but also are likely to make things worse. Realists are not necessarily conservative--a few are radical--but they have learned much from conservatives. By temperament, they are not confident of the capacities of human agencies. 
Realism also is a distinct approach to the conduct and the study of international relations. Realists have basic tenets--states are primary actors and operate to increase their relative power in a world in which anarchy puts a premium on self-help--that guide their thinking about international relations, but the readings on realism in international relations will highlight the underlying politics of realists. We will consider the realist emphasis on power, the status of morality, the relationship between power and morality, what critics of realists have to say about the realist treatment of these issues, and how realism in international relations connects with realism as a political sensibility.

It is imagined as existing in historic seclusion, and, following the establishment of the People's Republic, as pursuing a path of autarky. Such separation has then only been somewhat modified by the set of economic reforms that Deng Xiaoping first instituted in the late 1970s. In this seminar we will seek to turn such conventional wisdom on its head through examining the role that transnational actors have played in shaping the course of modern Chinese politics. However, the course's primary focus will not be upon the past, but rather the present.  More specifically, it will concentrate on the recent rise of a new class of Chinese transnational public intellectuals who have recently risen to prominence within the PRC.  It will also seek to identify the influence such individuals are having upon not only their fields of expertise, but also upon broader Chinese debates about collective identity and the country's place in a rapidly changing international system. Coming to terms with such issues will provide those who enroll in the seminar with a deeper, more nuanced, understanding of China's rise and this trend's implications for the rest of the world. We will accomplish this task through a combination of surveying the existing literature on China and transnational politics, considering new theoretical perspectives on both, and developing individual research projects that will explore aspects of the political dynamics that are at the core of the seminar.",seminar,"class participation, 2 short papers (3-4 pages), and a research paper (20-25 pages)",not open to first-years,20,15,"International Studies concentrators, Political Science majors, and Asian Studies majors",,,,,,Division 2,,,,INST East Asian Studies Electives,,,,,,,,,,01,SEM,W,01:10,03:50,Paresky 207,,,,,,,,,Carlson,Allen,,,,,,,,,,,PSCI, 356,1151

Amidst bourgeoning national self-consciousness throughout the continent, despite the liberatory promises of the Enlightenment, Jews remained a vulnerable, segregated, and stigmatized minority population. Jews had to decide where to pin their hopes. Should they ally themselves with the liberals or the communists? Should they embrace nationalism or cosmopolitanism? Should they, perhaps, abandon Europe altogether and re-constitute themselves  elsewhere? If so, should they focus their efforts on relocation to the historical land of Israel? Or could they go anywhere? Wherever they might go, should they aspire to build a modern Jewish nation-state, a semi-autonomous Jewish community, or some other arrangement? Should this coincide with the cultivation of a distinctively Jewish modern language? If so, should it be Hebrew or Yiddish? In this course we will assess various answers to these questions proffered by Jewish political thinkers in the modern period. We will pay particular attention to the construction of ""Jews"" and ""Judaism"" in these arguments.

Whether or not we regard this particular encyclopedic fact as especially important, few disagree with the idea that, when it comes to politics and citizenship, Americans are an ill-informed people. But what exactly would we want Americans to know more about? And how exactly might we get them to learn it? Taking these questions as its starting points, this senior seminar will tackle the state of civic education in America -- its promise and its pitfalls, its past iterations and its practice in contemporary times. In the first half of the semester, we will look closely at a series of debates about the goals, substance, and effect of civic education, including whether (and why) we should want it, what exactly it can and should look like (perhaps looking to civic education in other nations for meaningful points of comparison), and what sorts of effects it may have on citizens individually and the polity at large. In the second half of the semester, we will seek to put what we have learned into action, with students selecting a particular subject (an institution, a value, a process) and developing a civic education curriculum around it for introduction at several distinct grade levels in local schools.

This seminar will focus on the politics of belonging in America. What does it mean to be an American?  If the U.S. is a nation of immigrants, why is immigration reform so difficult to achieve?  Are legal citizenship and formal political rights sufficient for belonging?  Or does full inclusion rest on the ability to exercise civil and social rights as well?

Over the past two hundred and near forty years the population has grown by many multiples, the character of the society has changed from part slave, agricultural and mercantilist to increasingly democratic, liberal, technologically dynamic and urban. Further, the United States of 1787 had recently won its freedom from the major imperial power of the period, England (thereby changing its status from colony to sovereign nation). Now, the United States is the major imperial power of the world (even if bedeviled by anti-American movements of various kinds). Beyond these differences are innumerable others - demographic, institutional, and political.   
The focus of the American Politics senior seminar for this year is whether the Constitutional Framework and the rationales that justified those arrangements remain well suited to our current circumstances. And, if not, what could or should be done to redress that ill fit. There are two considerations that will broadly shape our deliberations and discussions this semester.  The first consideration will be an analytic one: what were the claims of justice and freedom that were the basis of the constitution and the American political institutions thereby created? These claims offer us some normative standards we can use as the basis to judge the success of American democracy, then and now.

Critics on the left worry that the United States is on an imperial quest, extorting resources from the global many for the advantage of an elite few. Critics on the right worry that the U.S. has abandoned the traditions that made it strong and has entered a period of moral decay. What are we to make of these different assessments? What do left and right see when they survey the nation, and why is what they see so different? Any diagnosis of contemporary maladies is premised on a vision of what a healthy functioning republic looks like. Our task in the seminar is to uncover and interrogate those visions.

In the last two decades, trials expanded dramatically in number, scope, and philosophy. Separate Ad Hoc Tribunals for crimes in Yugoslavia and those in Rwanda, in Sierra Leone and in Cambodia are giving way to a permanent International Criminal Court, which has begun to hand down indictments and refine its jurisdiction. At the same time, worries about residual impunity or the effect that punishment might have on societies' futures has led to the development of national and social courts to complement those at the international level.

We will also pay attention to the influence of Freud on Herbert Marcuse's critique of civilization. The second part of the course turns to the writings of Walter Benjamin and Ernst Bloch, whose efforts to reconstruct emancipatory ideals in Marxist thought after the collapse of communist and socialist teleologies have been described as ""maverick"" and ""utopian.""

For example, many political philosophers begin their political programs by asserting some foundational claims about ""human nature"" which in turn led them to their justification for their vision of politics. For example, the enlightenment thinkers held that science and technology would strengthen rationality and thereby making democracy more viable. On the other hand, those who defend authoritarian regimes often do so by proclaiming that the general public is incapable of rationality and of self-rule and should therefor accept rule by their betters. Many of these arguments turn on how rational people are and on their capacity for and willingness to pursue justice for all people. We explore what psychology tells us about people as political citizens and as leaders. The course pays special attention to the powerful, but surprising, roles that emotions play in all aspects of politics. Central to politics is the general issue of judgment, and its more important variants, moral and political judgment. If we are to trust ourselves to rule ourselves, how well will we secure justice and liberty for one and all among us? Political psychology is one of the very oldest disciplines (it can be dated at least back to the early classic Greeks, among them Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle).

In other words, what does it mean to say we live in a secular society? Is there a connection between national religiosity and a secular ""separation of church and state""? Is there a necessary connection between modernity and secularism? Can people be religious and secular at the same time? What is the relation between secularism and feminism? Is secularism and secularization unique to Europe and North America? Or is it merely the outward justification of a particular Euro-American ideological/colonial project?

We start with the origin of the writings before they became collected into the New Testament, and ask: what forms of writings (genres) in Greco-Roman culture were available to the authors of the new scriptures, and how they were used for the purpose of shaping faith in Jesus Christ and creating communities? Why just these scriptures were included, and not others, for instance, the Gospel of Thomas, is another much discussed question. The impact of the New Testament writings upon society is a problematic history; for instance, they have been used to support negative attitudes to Jews, women and homosexuals. This raises the issue of how to read the New Testament. There are many different ways of reading the New Testament; perhaps the most common way to read it is as Scripture, important for one's religious faith.

The purpose is to provide a survey of issues in Islamic social and intellectual history from the Shi'ite margin. On that margin, Shi'ism has always been an alliance of the dispossessed and the intellectuals (assuming the latter are not among the former) and functioned in Islam to provide a vocabulary of revolution, a highly developed philosophy of religion, and a pietistic fervor in contrast to which Sunnism emerged. One consequence, intended or not, of recent U.S. actions in the Middle East has been to inflame the Sunni/Shi'ite conflicts and raise fears of Shi'ite ascendancy. But sectarian conflict is, in fact, the exception rather than the rule in Islamic history because Sunnis and Shi'a have in most places been separated or lived relatively peacefully together where they intermixed.

We are also interested in the socio-cultural forces that reproduce or shore up these binaries as much as third terms or middle paths that attempt to transcend or diffuse them.

Exploring this possibility, this course examines the relevance of fundamental anthropological concepts that have developed through the structural and symbolic study of myth and ritual to the contemporary world in which we live. The course is divided into four sections. In the first unit, we read and discuss the work of Mary Douglas, Victor Turner, and Marshall Sahlins on myth and ritual, focusing in particular on the ways in which different cultures construct categories of inclusion and exclusion, safe and dangerous, pure and impure, while also creating the ""in between"" spaces within which both creativity and transgression emerge. On this foundation, we move to the second unit in which we discuss the structural relationship between ritual, power, and transgression in western contexts, taking the majority of our examples from early modern European and American history.

This course will examine shifting attitudes and approaches to human labor in the history of western thought. We will begin with a multifaceted consideration of why we work and the ways in which approaches to human labor intertwined with reflections on human inequality, especially slavery and its justification, and the identification between poverty and the resistance to hard work.  With the abolition of slavery and consequent arrival of modernity, two trends are strikingly added to the traditional discourses on work: the workplace as the public site for the achievement of justice, e.g., a living wage, workplace safety and equality of opportunity; and the articulation of individual identity and worth in the context of work, e.g., notions of profession, career and status.  The legacy of both those trends is still very much with us, but the twentieth century dislodged the focus on humans as laborers in favor of a view of them as consumers.  That is in part a consequence of the continuing shift from a production to a service economy, but also is intimately connected with the fortunately incomplete licensing of desire and leisure that are becoming the hallmark of both our current consumer economy and workplace. These competing issues leave us with the central split in American society between the slightly larger portion of Americans who say they 'get a sense of identity from their jobs' and the remaining significant minority who describe their jobs as 'just what they do for a living.' This course will explore some of the reasons for this fundamental cleavage.

We start with Gadamer's hermeneutics, which offers a classical formulation of the philosophy of liberal arts education, stressing the importance of questioning one's prejudices. Although this approach offers important resources for understanding ourselves in a world of cultural differences, it also has limitations, which we explore through the works of Derrida, Foucault and Said. In this way, we question some of the notions central to understanding ourselves such as identity and difference, suggesting some of the difficulties in the ever more important yet problematic project of knowing oneself. We also suggest that representation is not innocent but always implicated in the world of power and its complexities, particularly within the colonial and postcolonial contexts explored by Said.

Does capitalism turn everything into a commodity or does it commercialize wonder? Does modernity mean alienation from nature, a withering of social community, the end of art, and a rejection of history, or is it humankind's liberation from the dogmas of the past?

Among the most common supernatural crimes is witchcraft, which societies can invoke to explain natural disasters and disease, and to blame these occurrences on specific individuals, often social outcasts. Witchcraft became a particular focus of fear and fascination in Early Modern Europe, when inquisitors, theologians and many ordinary people came to believe that Western Christendom was threatened by a vast, covert conspiracy of witches in league with the devil. Countless ""witches""--most of them women--were accordingly tried, tortured and sometimes even executed. Our course will examine these bizarre events and consider what religious, cultural and intellectual factors might help explain them.

In this course, we will study novels by Gide, Proust, Colette, Camus, Martin du Gard, Mauriac, Malraux, and Sartre. Although there is great diversity among these authors, they were all reacting to the aftermath of the First World War and the breakdown of traditional French culture. Through the popular character of the rebellious adolescent, they experimented with revolt against the stifling social order of Church and family. The real challenge of the period, however, concerned not a break with the past or discoveries of new levels of consciousness and freedom, but rather the mature acceptance of responsibility for the future and the articulation of fresh spiritual and political visions. <I>Conducted in French</I>.",,several short papers and oral class presentations,any RLFR literature course or permission of the instructor,,,,,,,,,Division 1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,LEC,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dunn,Susan,,,,,,,,,,,RLFR, 314,1081

Similarly, writers from Hugo to Zola have simultaneously celebrated Parisian elegance and condemned the appalling misery of Paris's urban poor. Since 1889, Paris has been fêted as the ""City of Light"" for its Enlightenment legacy, its Eiffel Tower modernity, and its luminous urban energy, captured in countless paintings, photographs, and film. However, Paris is also the historical site of revolution, resistance, and riots. From revolutionary revolt (1830, 1848, 1871), to wartime resistance (1870, 1914-18, 1940-44), to reformist and race riots (1968 and 2005), Paris has repetitively sparked with incendiary passion and political protest. As fires raged during the riots in 2005, many heard the echo of Hitler's ominous 1944 question, ""Is Paris burning?"" and asked: why was Paris burning again at the dawn of the twenty-first century? To answer this question, we will examine the social, political, and literary landscape of Paris during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, from urbanization and modernization, to occupation and liberation, to immigration and globalization. Readings to include poetry, short stories, and novels by Hugo, Balzac, Baudelaire, Maupassant, Verne, Zola, Apollinaire, Colette, Duras, Perec, Rochefort, and Charef.

But in Verne's vision of modernity, technological sophistication gives way to intellectual stagnation and social indifference, in a world where poetry and literature have been abandoned in favor bureaucratic efficiency, mechanized surveillance, and the merciless pursuit of profit. To contest or confirm this dystopic vision, we will examine a broad range of twentieth-century novels and their focus on adversity, dignity, and modernity. In a century dominated by the devastation of two World Wars, the atrocities of colonial empire, and massive social and political transformation, the novel both documented and interrogated France's engagement with race and ethnicity, gender and sexuality, colonialism and immigration. Within this historical context, we will discuss the role of the novel in confronting war and disease, challenging poverty and greed, and exposing urban isolation and cultural alienation in twentieth-century France. Readings to include novels by Colette, Genet, Camus, Duras, Ernaux, Guibert, and Begag.

Sound it: you will never know its depth."" The same can be said of the French nineteenth-century novel and its boundless ability to echo the historical past and reverberate in the cultural present. Desperate housewives, sex in the city, queer eyes for straight guys, and extreme makeovers fill the pages of the nineteenth-century novel. From the Romanticism of Stendhal and Hugo, and the Realism of Balzac and Flaubert, to the Naturalism of Maupassant and Zola, the novel became an extraordinary forum for examining illicit sexuality, institutional misogyny, social injustice, criminal passions, revolutionary struggles, and Parisian pleasures in nineteenth-century France. Characters such as the imprisoned housewife Emma Bovary, the reluctant revolutionary Jean Valjean, the social-climbing lover Julien Sorel, the ambitious undergraduate Rastignac, the domestically-abused Gervaise, and the man-eating courtesan Nana became synonymous with France's turbulent social and political landscape from the 1830s to the 1880s. And as recent film adaptations make clear, these characters continue to haunt our twenty-first century present. Reinterpreted by such contemporary actors as Gérard Depardieu, Isabelle Huppert, Uma Thurman, Claire Danes, and Jennifer Aniston, the nineteenth-century novel continues to sound out the scandalous and sensational depths of our own century.

This seminar will explore the role of censorship in eighteenth-century France, another complex period transformed in part by unprecedented access to knowledge. Students will critically assess a range of works that were, before or after publication, repressed or altered by various religious and civil authorities, editors, publishers, and, in some cases, audiences. Discussions will focus on the formal and thematic content of each work, as well as its broader place in Enlightenment and French Revolutionary literature and culture. Analysis of such historically-specific concepts as tolerance, obscenity, and public censorship will be supported by critical work and commentary from the eighteenth century and the present day. As a central feature of the course, students will conduct a semester-long research project that will draw on readings from Voltaire, Diderot, Rousseau, Sade, Beaumarchais, Chénier, Gouges, Charrière, Staël, and others.

Representing a wide variety of geographies, literary styles and ideological perspectives, these writers nevertheless converge in challenging us to consider the effects of environmental crisis within structures of power that are radically unequal at the local, national, and global levels; and to recognize that consciousness of environmental vulnerability can prompt new forms of inclusion and community as well as exclusion. Topics to be explored also include the role of indigenous cosmologies in contemporary environmental politics, the place of urban ecologies within the environmental imaginary, and the ongoing debates among academic critics and others regarding the scope and methodologies of ecocriticism as an approach to Latin American literature.

This is an attractive myth for sure, but also a very simplistic one. It does not begin to take into account the complexity of Iberia, whose regional identities, crises of sovereignty and complicated allegiances were hardly ever constant in the medieval period. The very notions of ""influence"" and  ""co-existence,"" which have long governed general assumptions about medieval Spain, become problematic if considered in the context of the actual time and place in which they are supposed to have occurred.

Today, however, news from the Former Soviet Union often sounds like a bizarrely gendered media stunt. For example, Russian president Vladimir Putin has been photographed topless while fishing on vacation in Siberia, while the feminist punk-rock collective Pussy Riot protested Putin's regime by performing in day-glo balaclavas in Russia's largest cathedral. This course examines related post-Soviet media spectacles in the attempt to understand the Western press's fascination with Russia, as well as key social trends defining the post-Soviet era. We will focus on the ways in which gender and sexuality have come to mark post-Soviet culture and discourse as different from those in the West. In addition to Vladimir Putin and Pussy Riot, we will consider the so-called crisis of masculinity in post-Soviet Russia, the trafficking of women from the Former Soviet Union, the revival of indigenous practices such as bride kidnapping in Kyrgyzstan and Buzkashi in Tajikistan, the Ukrainian feminist collective Femen, the Eurovision Song Context, and the 2013 legislation in the Russian Federation banning homosexual propaganda among minors. We will try to understand how concepts, such as feminism, tolerance of sexual minorities, and performed gender, have been deemed dangerous in the post-Soviet East at the very time they have attained normative status in the West.

For a number of reasons (political, aesthetic, professional, ethical) Babel was not prolific and this will allow us to read almost all of his creative output, something we rarely get to do in the course of a single semester.  Babel's writing is extremely varied--it includes sketches, journalistic prose, short stories, plays, movie scripts, one unfinished novel--and richly intertextual.  This will afford us the opportunity to read the work of some of his contemporaries and predecessors, from both Russia and abroad, with whom he fashioned brilliant literary conversations, among them Guy de Maupassant, Anton Chekhov, Sholem Aleichem, and Ivan Turgenev.  Babel saw self-definition as the core of his writing and  as an EDI offering, this course will ask students to reflect on what it meant to be a Russian, a Jew, and a non-party author--an outsider, insider, and problematic hybrid rolled into one--in the highly unsettled, and unsettling, 1920s and 1930s.   <I>All course readings will be in translation, but students are highly encouraged to read in the original (Russian, French, Yiddish) whenever possible.</I>",seminar,"active class participation, frequent short writing assignments, a final project, and an oral presentation",none,12,10,"Russian and COMP majors, JWST and INST concentrators",,meets Division 1 requirement if registration is under RUSS or COMP; meets Division 2 requirement if registration is under JWST or INST,,,,Division 1,Exploring Diversity,,Writing Intensive,INST Russian + Eurasian Studies Electives,,,,,,,,,,,SEM,,,,,,,,,,,,,van de Stadt,Janneke,,,,,,,,,,,RUSS, 343,1141

In brief, medicalization refers to those processes by which a myriad of previously {non}medical problems, once defined as ethical-religious, legal or social (e.g. drug and alcohol addition, shyness, obesity), are brought within the purview of medical science and redefined as medical problems, usually in terms of ""illness"" or ""disorder"". We will begin the course by attending to the history of medicalization and its consequences. Taking guidance from key theoretical works and exemplary case studies, we will arrive at an understanding of medicalization as a {technical} process, and modern medicine as a quite potent form of {social control}. We will then move from a consideration of medicalization to biomedicalization; from the management of human life to transformations of ""life itself"" by way of post-World War II technoscientific interventions aimed at ""optimizing"" the vitality of individuals, groups, and entire populations. In particular, we will consider empirical case studies of technoscientific developments that have made possible the work of optimization that defines biomedicalization: molecular biology, pharmacogenomics, biotechnologies, imaging techniques (EEG, PET, and fMRI), robotics, and transplant medicine, among others. Finally, we will attend to how processes of biomedical optimization have produced new ways of seeing, knowing, and imagining human bodies, such that biology is increasingly less representative of ""destiny"" than it is of possibility.

How have products - ranging from beer to deodorant to cigarettes -- had their use value articulated in gendered ways? Why must masculinity be the purview of ""males"" at all; how can we change discourses to better include performances of female masculinities, butch-identified women, and trans* men? We will pay particular attention to racialized, queer, and subaltern masculinities.

These two critical modes-reading the text versus performing the script-are often treated in compartmentalized fashion as separate, even incompatible activities. Our goal is to take up the challenge of bringing the two perspectives together within the framework of a single, integrated course. The teaching method is to bridge the gap between the two modes not by magically dissolving, but by actively engaging, the tensions between them. For example, no performance can include all the possible interpretations; performance decisions raise questions about what alternatives have been left out. Similarly, when all interpretive possibilities are held in imaginative suspension, the specifics of bodily movement and face-to-face interaction whose meanings emerge when enacted are lost. We propose to put the two orientations in a productive and innovative dialogue that enables students to experience the tension from both sides, to articulate the opportunities and limits of each side, and to combine their respective strengths. The mix of assignments (papers and scene work) will vary depending on whether students designate themselves as primarily scholars or actors, but some overlap will be built in to ensure that scholars gain understanding of acting and actors gain access to scholarship.

What's the secret?  Who is lying?  Who is quietly disregarding the rules?  The revelation of hidden knowledge--what Aristotle called anagnorisis--lies at the base of what drama is, and how theatre functions. Theatre is lying as much as lying is theatre.  So it should not be a surprise that playwrights often deliver plots and characters that pit playing against truth, and that oppose concealment and revelation as keys to dramatic action. But it should also not surprise that in the modern era, clarity in the dialectic of  ""truth and falsehood"" has eroded as well.  Relativity of honesty, contingency with regard to certain knowledge, ""truthiness""--these too have a place in the modern theatre.  This tutorial course will examine what lies hidden in American plays from the late nineteenth century to the early twenty-first.

What is a ""repertoire""? What are the benefits and risks of continuity over time?
Taught as part of the Books Unbound curricular initiative, and in conjunction with the opening of the Sawyer-Stetson Library, the course will complete a project in which the class ""embodies"" material, first by exploring stories embodied by individual members of the class, and then by translating them through performance by the collective, culminating in dance/theatre pieces performed in the new library.

In many societies in the 20th and 21st centuries, the theatre has been a space where, within that famed ""two hour traffic of our stage"", struggle has been a major theme, and opposition can, somehow, be voiced. The theatre is a place of parable and of storytelling, a place where comedy and satire as well as tragedy find within their audiences a recognition and an identification. Put this way, theatre can be and has been a powerful, sometimes even dangerous tool. The Seminar will look at ""Struggle Theatre"" in the 20th Century.

The course will examine issues such as: body politics, sexuality, reproductive rights, sexual violence, gender and work, motherhood and family, homophobia, transgendered people's experiences in the US and abroad.  Above all, the course is intended as an exploration of the tremendous diversity of thought contained under the general rubrics of feminist, gender, and sexuality studies and as a vehicle for developing skills in writing and research, as well as analytical tools for further work in the field. This course meets the requirements of the Exploring Diversity Initiative in that its main emphases are on challenging the notion of one universalizing category of ""woman,"" and to recognize the diverse ways in which national, sexual, ethnic, racial, classed and other kinds of differences produce multiple and often divergent relations of gendered power. It also whenever possible contextualizes within a global frame the central issues that have made up and continue to define the U.S. feminist tradition, in order to encourage students to recognize the role cultural difference plays in a variety of feminist issues and to decenter the U.S as a reference point for all feminist theory and politics.

Butler (1947-2006) is among the most highly regarded science fiction writers. Butler's uncanny ability to imagine the future anew and to merge those ruminations with her experiences as an African American woman provide powerful commentary on -- and often disrupt -- modern understandings of race, gender, and human embodiment. We will explore questions such as: What role does `gender' play in Butler's fiction? How does Butler's treatment of the `alien' cause us to reconsider what it means to be human? How does Butler incorporate `race' and the concept of `other' into her fiction, and how do these techniques help us situate contemporary discussions of a post-race society? We will examine the relationship between Butler's visions for the future and what her narratives of future worlds invariably suggest about the present. We will read key texts including the best-selling text <I>Kindred</I> (1979), the haunting dystopian novel <I>Parable of the Sower</I> (1994), the popular vampire text <I>Fledgling</I> (2005), and the collection <I>Bloodchild and Other Stories</I> (1996).

Today, however, news from the Former Soviet Union often sounds like a bizarrely gendered media stunt. For example, Russian president Vladimir Putin has been photographed topless while fishing on vacation in Siberia, while the feminist punk-rock collective Pussy Riot protested Putin's regime by performing in day-glo balaclavas in Russia's largest cathedral. This course examines related post-Soviet media spectacles in the attempt to understand the Western press's fascination with Russia, as well as key social trends defining the post-Soviet era. We will focus on the ways in which gender and sexuality have come to mark post-Soviet culture and discourse as different from those in the West. In addition to Vladimir Putin and Pussy Riot, we will consider the so-called crisis of masculinity in post-Soviet Russia, the trafficking of women from the Former Soviet Union, the revival of indigenous practices such as bride kidnapping in Kyrgyzstan and Buzkashi in Tajikistan, the Ukrainian feminist collective Femen, the Eurovision Song Context, and the 2013 legislation in the Russian Federation banning homosexual propaganda among minors. We will try to understand how concepts, such as feminism, tolerance of sexual minorities, and performed gender, have been deemed dangerous in the post-Soviet East at the very time they have attained normative status in the West.

On the one hand, shifting ideas about gender have influenced the development of the sciences through history: for example, some feminists argue that science has historically been premised upon a view of women as objects, not subjects, of knowledge. On the other hand, shifting ideas about science have strongly influenced the development of feminist theory and practice: for example, debates about reproductive rights are often couched in terms of a conflict between reliable scientific knowledge of embryos, STDs, etc. and an unscientific, patriarchal worldview. Do science and technology serve to transform or reinforce power imbalances based on gender, race, and sexuality? Should feminist theory embrace objectivity and model itself upon scientific procedures of knowledge production? Or should feminists reject objectivity as a myth told by the powerful about their own knowledge-claims and develop an alternative approach to knowledge? What is ""objectivity"" anyway, and how has this norm changed through history? What kinds of alternatives to objectivity exist, and should they, too, count as ""science""?

However movements in countries including Brazil, France, Canada and Spain are demonstrating otherwise. Theorists, practitioners and social activists are adopting labels including 'Solidarity Economy' and 'New Economy' to group together economic activities based on ideals of human provisioning, social justice and environmental sustainability. They point out that many of these activities are already taking place and are often crucial to our lives, but rendered invisible by economic theory. In the words of Brazilian popular educator and economist Marcos Arruda, 'a solidarity economy does not arise from thinkers or ideas; it is the outcome of the concrete historical struggle of the human being to live and to develop him/herself as an individual and a collective.' In this tutorial we will learn and debate about some of the activities being named and built under this label, such as the networks of worker-owned cooperatives in Mondragon, Spain, the growth of local currencies and time exchanges, open source development, fair trade organizations and different ways of organizing care work. We will look at some of the history and debates around worker-owned cooperatives, ranging from Victorian England through African-American experiences throughout the 20th century, to examples in post-Independence Africa. The ILO declared 2012 the International Year of Cooperatives and argued that they are a particularly appropriate form to African development. Is this plausible, and what role might coops play in AIDS-affected communities? Feminist geographers Julie Graham and Katherine Gibson developed practices of 'mapping' local economies with communities in Australia and Western Massachusetts in ways that bring to light the invisible resources and practices of provisioning and solidarity, and challenge what they describe, drawing on the work of feminist theorist Sharon Marcus, as a 'script' of local helplessness to resist the 'rape' of their economies by the forces of global capitalism. Do these proposed discursive practices actually present realistic possibilities for producing sustained economic change? And finally, why is the solidarity economy now so much more advanced in other countries than the US?

These two critical modes-reading the text versus performing the script-are often treated in compartmentalized fashion as separate, even incompatible activities. Our goal is to take up the challenge of bringing the two perspectives together within the framework of a single, integrated course. The teaching method is to bridge the gap between the two modes not by magically dissolving, but by actively engaging, the tensions between them. For example, no performance can include all the possible interpretations; performance decisions raise questions about what alternatives have been left out. Similarly, when all interpretive possibilities are held in imaginative suspension, the specifics of bodily movement and face-to-face interaction whose meanings emerge when enacted are lost. We propose to put the two orientations in a productive and innovative dialogue that enables students to experience the tension from both sides, to articulate the opportunities and limits of each side, and to combine their respective strengths. The mix of assignments (papers and scene work) will vary depending on whether students designate themselves as primarily scholars or actors, but some overlap will be built in to ensure that scholars gain understanding of acting and actors gain access to scholarship. All students will be expected to demonstrate versatility in traversing the full spectrum from interpretation through reading to interpretation through performance.The specific topic that will bring these theoretical issues into focus is the matter of sex and sexual identity, as illuminated through the analysis of language, psychology, and theatrical embodiment. Six plays will be studied in depth: <I>The Merchant of Venice</I>, <I>Twelfth Night</I>, <I>Othello</I>, <I>King Lear</I>, <I>Antony and Cleopatra</I>, and <I>The Winter's Tale</I>.","lecture/discussion, with additional periods set aside for scene presentation","evaluation will be based on several short papers and a final exam All students will take the final: ""scholar"" students will have rigorous expectations in the writing of papers; ""actor"" students will have intensive (graded) performance expectations",none; students wishing to enroll as Acting Students should consult with instructors,20,15,,,meets Division 1 requirement if registration is under EXPR or THEA; meets Division 2 requirement if registration is under WGSS,,,,Division 1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WGSS, 245,

India's rapidly growing populace and landscape is often described in terms of multiple identities or fragmenting oppositions: Hindu/Muslim, rich/poor, high caste/outcaste, male/female, and so forth. This course deconstructs the historic roots and ongoing causal factors that produce structural violence against women and religious minorities in modern India.  It highlights the social practices that have produced critical axes of difference around the themes of religion, gender, and sexuality using key moments or regions of India as points of departure.  It contrasts the explosive effects of religion, gender, and caste during the tragedy of Partition with the ongoing production of communal and gender-based violence in India today, using Kashmir and New Delhi as microcosms for our study. We will consider the ways that multiple subjectivities and polarized identities intersect with individual agency to produce a social landscape of hierarchy and conflict across India today.  We are also interested in the socio-cultural forces that reproduce or shore up these binaries as much as third terms or middle paths that attempt to transcend or diffuse them.  For instance, we explore the ways that Buddhism is and is not a middle way between Hindu/Muslim conflict in Indian Kashmir and how the notion of a third sex is and is not a middle term that transcends the gender binary of male/female.

The course uses the body as a lens by which to unpack South Asian discourses that link body and sexuality with nation, community, and population. In particular, it explores a South Asian sociology that links individual and social bodies in ways that occasion solidarity as well as social suffering, violence as well as communal cohesion. How do bodies come to signify the purity or prosperity of the nation or community and with what social or discursive effects? We begin by unpacking foundational theories of the body as proposed by Mauss, Foucault, Douglas, and Bourdieu in order to better understand how local discourses of the body help produce gender and other social hierarchies in South Asia. By considering how the human body can serve as a map for society and vice versa, we examine both classical discourses and modern institutional practices of the body including the temple, the monastery, the mosque, and the mendicant, as well as bodily practices such as yoga, celibacy, sex work, and new reproductive technologies. We also analyze how the body has served as a symbol of nation, community, and social health.

Our texts include scholarly works as well as science fiction novels, plays, films, diaries, and graphic novels.  Methodologically, we draw on many fields of study, including anthropology, literary studies, feminist studies, and ethnic studies. We focus primarily but by no means exclusively on US contexts, paying particular attention to the role that urban environments have served for queer communities of color.  Topics include: feminisms of color, inter-racial desire and fetishization, orientalism and colonial fantasy, black queer science fiction, transgender subjectivities, and the political economy of sexual desire.

Similarly, writers from Hugo to Zola have simultaneously celebrated Parisian elegance and condemned the appalling misery of Paris's urban poor. Since 1889, Paris has been fêted as the ""City of Light"" for its Enlightenment legacy, its Eiffel Tower modernity, and its luminous urban energy, captured in countless paintings, photographs, and film. However, Paris is also the historical site of revolution, resistance, and riots. From revolutionary revolt (1830, 1848, 1871), to wartime resistance (1870, 1914-18, 1940-44), to reformist and race riots (1968 and 2005), Paris has repetitively sparked with incendiary passion and political protest. As fires raged during the riots in 2005, many heard the echo of Hitler's ominous 1944 question, ""Is Paris burning?"" and asked: why was Paris burning again at the dawn of the twenty-first century? To answer this question, we will examine the social, political, and literary landscape of Paris during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, from urbanization and modernization, to occupation and liberation, to immigration and globalization.

In this course, we will think about what medieval texts can tell us about desire and how we might understand its modes within a wider perspective of a history of sexuality. In addition to investigating the theme of courtly love in medieval romance, we will explore troubadour poetry, saint's lives, theological treatises, courtesy manuals, and mystical visions. We will frame our investigation around some of the most influential narratives regarding the evolution of sexuality, including those of Michel Foucault, David Halperin and Karma Lochrie, in order to analyze how medieval texts uphold and sometimes challenge received notions about how, when, and whether these categories emerged. In our investigation, we will cover the paradox of virginity, the rise of a knightly class as an experiment in the homosocial, the poetics of desire, the sexuality of grammar, and more.

How might the analytic of performance equip us in this course to identify marginalized modes of being and to enact anti-xenophobic strategies for everyday practice? In this course we will study multiple forms of contemporary performance (including performance art, visual art, sound art, social media, literature, politics, and performance of everyday life) by artists of diverse racial, gender, and sexual identification to think about belonging and alternative forms of world-making.
We will explore these questions in a United States context through engagement with cultural texts that destabilize ideological binaries of female/male, black/white, heterosexual/homosexual, subject/object, and human/non-human, including scholarship in critical ethnic studies, queer of color critique, and affect studies. We will begin with linguistic philosopher J.L. Austin's theory of the performative speech act, and proceed with theorists including Judith Butler and José Esteban Muñoz to consider gender and racial performativities. Artists studied will range from the conceptual (including Adrian Piper, Nao Bustamante, and Yoko Ono) to the popular (including Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, R. Kelly). This course will engage foundational texts to performance studies and offer an interdisciplinary approach to scholarship in gender and sexuality studies, critical ethnic studies, and performance studies from the 1970s to the present. This course recognizes a suspicion for diversity discourses that universalize human experience and asks: how do we resist normativizing forces without reinforcing the regulating logics of those forces?

In the 1950s, sociologists argued about the extent to which postwar affluence was leading to the ""embourgeoisement"" of the working class; in the 1960s, the advent of the so-called ""Permissive Society"" witnessed the flourishing of a new culture of sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll; in the 1970s, the feminist and gay movements challenged gender roles that earlier had seemed so secure; in the 1980s, Thatcherism sought to halt the nation's apparent terminal decline, repudiating much of the progressive legislation of earlier decades; finally, throughout this period successive ways of immigration challenged the cultural homogeneity of white Britain. This course will explore these themes, addressing the question of what it meant to be ""postwar"" in Britain, charting the gradual emergence of a new politics of class, gender, race, and sexuality in Britain that the made the nation in 1990, at the end of the postwar period, a radically different place from what it had been in 1945.

We will pay attention to the fictional  modes by which apparently intractable social problems are resolved,  through a sleight of hand act we seem never to tire of, in the realm  of romantic love. And while we might think of the novel as an <I>Empire  of the Little</I>, endlessly occupied with giving significance to the smallest acts of ordinary human life, we will think about the  broader historical and social conditions the novel both represents  in its pages, and is a crucial not-so-silent partner in promoting  and contesting.

Lorde was a queer feminist icon credited with furthering the concepts of intersectional identity and black feminism, while Baraka was accused throughout his career of obliviously brazen machismo and criticized for his use of homophobic invective.  Baraka endorsed the very notions of leadership and community from which Lorde crafted an identity of marginality, and Lorde endorsed a community-bound poetics contrasted to Baraka's avant-gardism. But for all their differences, Lorde and Baraka were arguably the two most significant African American writers of the late twentieth century, and, however surprisingly, they staked similar conceptual territory, addressing such themes as the possibility of spiritual self-discovery, the possibility of liberatory consciousness, the significance of emotions in building community, and the relationship between sexuality and racial identity. We will explore such issues by way of closely attending to their texts, and since another similarity between them was a prolific range of genre, we will have the opportunity to delve into poetry, essays, fiction, drama, and memoir, with a slight but definite preference for their poetry. We will also place these writers in their political and philosophical contexts, sampling secondary sources on the Black Arts movement, queer theory, contemporary American and African American poetry, and transnational black studies. As we will be discussing two writers whose collective contribution to minority discourse is nothing short of monumental, our course will participate in the College's Exploring Diversity Initiative.

But as the great theorist of children's animation and stoner movies Jack Halberstam has noted, sometimes failure turns out to be a better bet than success: it can reveal the blindspots of dominant ideologies, while opening up alternative ways of living in the world.  This course will take a long detour through meditations on failure emerging from queer theory, Asian American studies, and black studies, with a particular interest in what failure can reveal about higher education and related disciplinary institutions, such as prisons or the so-called ""internment camps"" for Japanese Americans during World War II.  This course fulfills the Exploring Diversity requirement by considering how the stigmatization of difference and justification of social inequality are inscribed in supposedly neutral rubrics of success and failure.

The class follows the development of ""whiteness"" through a chronology that begins in colonial Virginia, travels through immigration in the nineteenth century, examines racial politics and popular culture in the twentieth century, and  ends  with a look at the current election season. This course is framed by several questions: What is whiteness, and what has it meant in the history of the United States? Who is (and is not) white? What about other analytical categories, like gender and class (or region or ethnicity or sexuality): how have these experiences shaped and been shaped by the racial category of whiteness? Because historically whiteness has carried overtones of power, privilege, and wealth in the United States, the course necessarily critiques the roots of racial disparities. This class is not for the faint-hearted. Informed participation is necessary to its success.

The past 25 years of queer studies, media, and activism (1990-2015) have led to unprecedented visibility and great advances for many LGBT people, especially in North America and Western Europe: from breakthroughs in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, to victories for Gays in the Military, Employment Non-Discrimination, and Gay Marriage in 16 US states and another 16 countries around the world. For many, however, this new era of queer life during the past 2 decades has eclipsed the time before, when those who were pejoratively labeled as queer struggled with homophobic discrimination, isolation, and violence, by seeking one another out in major cities, specific neighborhoods, underground bars, and in the narrative spaces of novels and films. As a result, many young people born after 1990 are largely unaware of these struggles that predate their lives, the internet, and social media; and several LGBT leaders worry that this has left many 18-25 year olds with a false sense of security, a decreasing interest in political engagement, alarming new rates of sexually transmitted infections, and a growing disinterest in queer social spaces beyond the virtual. In this course, we will explore the literary, cinematic, and cultural history of gay and lesbian lives before the 1990s, and consider what has been gained and lost. Topics to include the early twentieth-century isolation of the closet, (1890s-1950s), the formation of clandestine gay and lesbian communities during and after World War II (1940s-60s), the Stonewall riots and the first decade of Gay Liberation (1969-1979), and the devastating losses and community responses to AIDS (1979-1995).

Sound it: you will never know its depth."" The same can be said of the French nineteenth-century novel and its boundless ability to echo the historical past and reverberate in the cultural present. Desperate housewives, sex in the city, queer eyes for straight guys, and extreme makeovers fill the pages of the nineteenth-century novel. From the Romanticism of Stendhal and Hugo, and the Realism of Balzac and Flaubert, to the Naturalism of Maupassant and Zola, the novel became an extraordinary forum for examining illicit sexuality, institutional misogyny, social injustice, criminal passions, revolutionary struggles, and Parisian pleasures in nineteenth-century France. Characters such as the imprisoned housewife Emma Bovary, the reluctant revolutionary Jean Valjean, the social-climbing lover Julien Sorel, the ambitious undergraduate Rastignac, the domestically-abused Gervaise, and the man-eating courtesan Nana became synonymous with France's turbulent social and political landscape from the 1830s to the 1880s. And as recent film adaptations make clear, these characters continue to haunt our twenty-first century present. Reinterpreted by such contemporary actors as Gérard Depardieu, Isabelle Huppert, Uma Thurman, Claire Danes, and Jennifer Aniston, the nineteenth-century novel continues to sound out the scandalous and sensational depths of our own century.

If modernist painting has often been understood to put pressure on existing power relations, the stylistic innovation that defines it has just as often been used to veil its controversial subject matter. The aim of this course is two-fold: 1) to call attention to difference through comparative analysis and to consider how and why identifying it is meaningful; 2) to detail the changes in historiography since the 1970s that have enabled discussions of difference (sex, class, race, ethnicity, sexuality) and the challenges they present. The course demonstrates that the Second Empire (1851-1870) in France was an especially fertile period for innovations in style and subject matter that generated both outrage and incomprehension. In the wake of the revolution of 1848, realism and its rallying cry (""il faut être de son temps"") brought home subjects that heretofore had been safely displaced to the classical or exotic worlds as they were imagined by the West. The Second Empire coincided with the birth of mass culture so that artists had access to new types of imagery and increasing contact with racy and controversial subjects. 
This course will investigate polemical works by Gustave Courbet (i.e. Burial at Ornans, Origin of the World) and Edouard Manet (i.e. Olympia, The Execution of Emperor Maximilian) through the lens of critical writings of the 1850s and 1860s (i.e. Baudelaire, Proudhon, Zola) as well as revisionist writings from the 1970s to the present (Homi Bhahba, T.J. Clark, Richard Dyer, Michael Fried, Tamar Garb, Sander Gilman, Zine Magubane, Linda Nochlin, and Gayatri Spivak).

This course looks at both male and female nudes from the time of the French revolution to the present in order to order how and why this gendering occurred. We will explore the ways in which certain types of bodies have been defined in opposition to the white western ideal, and thereby exoticized and marginalized. Our prime focus is the work of David, Ingres, Courbet, Gericault, Manet and Renoir but more popular nineteenth-century images as well as selected works by artists working in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries will be discussed.",seminar,"evaluation will be based on biweekly 1-page papers, short reports, an oral presentation and a 10- to 20-page paper",Two semesters of ARTH 101-102-103;  permission of instructor required,12,,"junior and senior Art majors, Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies majors, French majors, and History majors with a concentration in European studies.",,meets Division 1 requirement if registration is under ARTH; meets Division 2 requirement if registration is under WGSS,,,,Division 1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEM,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ockman,Carol,,,,,,,,,,,WGSS, 451,1143

We will pay particular attention to the roles women filled--as slaves, nuns, housewives, mothers, and workers, as well as depictions of women as witches, paragons of virtue, and urban consumers. In our reading of historiography and primary texts we will analyze the ways in which literacy and artistic culture as well as geopolitical events shaped women's lives. As we study works of history, we will also read modern works of feminist and race theory to further our understanding of connections between ideology and practice, between narrative and argument.",seminar,"a research paper (20-25 pages), based on reading and analysis of a set of primary sources, a literature review, class participation, and an informal reading journal",none,15,10-15,"advanced History majors and to Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies majors",,,,,,Division 2,,,,HIST Group F Electives - U.S. + Canada,HIST Group G Electives - Premodern,,,,,,,,,,SEM,,,,,,,,,,,,,Long,Gretchen,,,,,,,,,,,WGSS, 452,1143

It examines how women have shaped the meanings of American citizenship through pursuit of political rights and obligations such as suffrage, jury duty, and military service; how those political struggles have varied across race, religion, and class; and how the legal system has shaped gender relations for both women and men through regulation of such issues as marriage, divorce, work, reproduction, and the family. While we will read some court cases, the focus of the seminar is on the broader relationship between law and society. Readings will address not only the history of statutory law, and of the lawsuits and trials testing those laws, but also the social history of the impact of the law and the political history of efforts to change laws.",seminar,"evaluation will be based on an extensive (20-25 page) research paper that makes use of primary and secondary sources, brief papers on the weekly readings, and class participation",none,15,10-15,senior History majors,,,,,,Division 2,,,,HIST Group F Electives - U.S. + Canada,JLST Enactment/Applications in Institutions,WGSS Theory Courses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WGSS, 457,
